# DSI_CS2

Proposal:
  Reddit is an online forum for posting topics of varying subjects. I will use regression and random forest techniques to create a model to predict the number of upvotes a post may receive.

Goal:
  Predict number of upvotes for a reddit post based on to-be-determined features.
