0,Big Catalyst tomorrow for RKT!,1,maubsk,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big_catalyst_tomorrow_for_rkt/,0,"Tomorrow's a big day for RKT!

At this point, it's painfully clear that the stock price is being artificially kept down. Shares available to borrow dropped from **6,700,000** last Tuesday to **200,000** today.

Let's do some quick maths:

Tomorrow all shareholders get a special dividend of $1.11 per share.

With a Public Float of 108.45 mm shares and 39.66 mm shares shorted (as of Feb 26 per Yahoo)

No we all know a dividend of $1.11 isn't going to scare shorts off. But what I believe will catch them off guard is the Re-Investment of those dividends.

If EVERYONE re-invests the dividend, that's:

(108.45mm+39.66mm) \* 1.11 = **$164,402,100**

$164,402,100 / $23.89 (Current Max Pain Price) = **6,881,628** shares of buying power! There are only **200,000** share left to borrow.

This could make the stock go **PARABOLIC**

# But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...

YES YOU DO. Why? Because think about who the retail investors who would be paying attention if/when it goes parabolic. These retail are Millennials and Gen Z. That means they are looking for their first car loans or first home loans! They are College Students and Grad Students, Engineers/ people passionate about creating change. Not only are they the exact demographic that would be Rocket consumers, they are also the exact demographic that Dan Gilbert wants to recruit to Detroit to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon!

Take me for example, I'm 32 and looking to buy my first home soon. I was planning to go the traditional route, talk to some banks... blah blah blah. After seeing RKT and reading about Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner, I'll most likely end up using Rocket! Now take me and times that by millions around the world!

By ""sacrificing"" your dividend (by buying into an undervalued stock... poor you), you would be boosting the value of the rest of your investment by improving the very fundamentals of the company itself. It's a no brainer!

# Don't most people take the dividend as cash?

Under normal circumstances at a mature company, yes, people take the cash because the company has nothing else to do with the money. This, however, is a **special** dividend. RKT is nowhere near done growing. In fact, they went public in order TO grow. They didn't do it for the cash. This is from an article from when they first went public. 

[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)

>*Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It¬†closed $145 billion in loans in 2019¬†and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion. Gilbert founded the company in 1985. In 2010, he moved its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. The company employs some 20,000 across the country with most based in Detroit.*  
>  
>***While Quicken's coffers do¬†not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said,¬†going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity¬†for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.***  
>  
>***""That‚Äôs a lot easier to do when you‚Äôre a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and¬†software people.""***

Dan Gilbert is trying to build the next Amazon... they only STARTED!!

This dividend was given out to bust the shorts. I'm sure many thought that the ANNOUCEMENT was to bust shorts....no... it's the **Re-Investment** that will bust shorts. 

The Play : Don't just buy options. That doesn't help, you just end up handing the MMs money. If you're not in this already, it should be a 60/40 split on Shares/ Options Or something like that. Obviously since the event is tomorrow, I bought a bunch of weekly options (not a lot compared to my overall investment in RKT), but I can't in good conscious recommend that to anyone, weeklies are just straight gambling. Buy shares! I'm not sure when the best options play would be since I'm not sure when the next catalyst would be, there's a buyback looming, could be anytime.

The purpose of this post is to show the technical signals before and after a tweet. I am NOT claiming any kind of causality, and this information is for entertainment/learning purposes.

Okay! Now let‚Äôs get into it.

First off, here is a list of all the tweets we will be looking at. Please note, theroaringkitty handle posts WAY more often than RC or Elon. So only a few of the most notable tweets were included.

Based on this, I can make a couple assumptions. First off, theroaringkitty handle tweeted at all times of momentum. There seem to be some tweets that are made during declining and inclining MACD histogram bars. Tweets also range when W%R and DMI Convergence/Divergence are at various levels. 

RC tweets seem to be tweeted as MACD histogram bars are rising, and RC tweets seem to be tweeted when there is general overbuying (W%R is medium-high). Also, RC tweets seem to usually come when there is a strong signal for an uptrend (+DI and ADX are both high).

Elon only tweeted once, but it was literally right before a giant spike in price. There are a few things that I find interesting about this tweet. Volume was very high leading up to the days of this tweet. The +DI to -DI divergence was very high the day before the tweet. Overbuying was very high (high W%R), and the MACD histogram bar doubled in the previous day.

Again, I don‚Äôt think we can assume causality from any of these tweets, but it is interesting to look at the technical signals leading up to or after a tweet.",1616465938.0

Hoping to buy another fraction of a share, I drove to my local GameStop only to find that it has gone out of business. I took this as a positive sign for their e-commerce business - this location was no longer needed to grow sales!

Undeterred in my quest to transform my PS4 into 0.4 shares, I borrowed gas money from my little brother to drive to the nearest store. Lo and behold, it was 8 days from going out of business and they weren't buying anything. Clearly, the pivot to e-commerce is moving faster than any of us expected and this thing is going to take off any day now. 

I didn't have enough gas to try the next nearest store, but if my wife's BF can give me a ride next weekend I'll post a follow-up. If that third store is also closing I plan to start selling my semi-vital organs.",1616465038.0

Two of China's regulators plan to bring the rules governing the sale of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco products in line with those for ordinary cigarettes.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and China's State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, posted online the draft regulations that could potentially curb the Vape industry.

 China's tobacco industry is controlled entirely via a government monopoly, and strict controls determine what companies and retailers can produce and sell cigarettes.

Cigarette sales generated 5.45% of China's overall tax revenue in 2018. For this reason, industry experts have long expected the state to intervene in the business operations of China's private e-cigarette companies.

In November 2019, Chinese regulators forbid e-commerce platforms from selling e-cigarette products online. The ban swiftly curbed the growth of the sector, and many brands focused their business toward offline sales.",1616464810.0
9,UPST (AI/ML enabled consumer lending and risk profiling),1,matroe,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/matroe/upst_aiml_enabled_consumer_lending_and_risk/,7,"No one seems to be talking about Upstart (Ticker: UPST). The company released earnings last week and beat expectations by 250% and increased their guidance for this year. Stock is up +215% from the recent low on March 5. Stock IPO'd in December, insiders are locked up for 6 months, and float is 44.6M shares (relatively low). Since beating earnings, on the very next day, all available shares for shorting have been shorted. Guys, the shortsellers are trying to keep this company from succeeding! That means they're against us in getting better access to credit and lower interest rates.

UPST, founded by ex-Google employees, uses AI/ML and alternative data e.g. college degree, geographic, employment history, payment history, job type, etc. basically everything else that can attest to your character and credit worthiness outside of a simple FICO score to create a smarter risk assessment on you and have the banks loan you money and lower interest rates.

>In a 2018 study, Upstart demonstrated to several large U.S. banks that our AI-based lending platform could almost triple their approval rates while holding losses constant compared to their current risk models.  
>  
>\-CEO, David Girouard (4Q2020 Earnings Call on March 5, 2021).

In other words, by using UPST's smarter credit models, the banks are able to lend out 3X more money without taking on increased risk/exposure on each loan. While FICO scores can be negatively impacted by one or two adverse events, UPST will look beyond what FICO sees to gauge your trustworthiness. Getting screwed by medical bills/insurance will destroy your FICO, but UPST could help the banks see past that and understand you have a solid job, payment history, degree, assets, etc. and get you the credit you need at the fair interest rate you should be getting, counter to what FICO suggests.

The company also announced on the earnings call of their acquisition of Prodigy Software to enter into the auto lending market. Want a better rate for your next car purchase and not get screwed by FICO? Upstart is making this happen.

This is the future...it's an amazing company/story/stock and a no-brainer opportunity. Squeeze the short sellers and decrease business' dependency on FICO scores for the betterment of society.

Market makers have hiked up the IV.  Which means you can only buy 2/3rds the amount of calls vs flat skew; thus reducing your ability to cause a gamma squeeze.**

Additional detail:

Skew is term to describe IV of Out-of-the-money strikes vs at-the-money.  Typically you will either see flat skew (all strikes similar IV), or skew in the lower strikes (higher IV).  Sometimes you will see negative skew (lower IV) in higher strikes.

\[Note: I am simply going to say lower or higher strikes rather than calls / puts, since they are synthetically the same depending on how much stock you have.  So for you all you noobs, a 1:1 covered call is synthetically the same as being short the same strike put\]

This is primarily due to supply/demand.  Since nearly everyone is net long, when they get scared they might either paper-hand their longs, or buy lower strike puts.  When their stocks are going up, they might sell higher strike calls (covered calls).  

But for GME the IV is much higher for the higher strikes.  This could be because:

* Too much demand, either a) apes going bananas or b) people who want to get front-spread (short at the money gamma) needing to buy out the money protection so that they can show their risk manager they don't have unlimited risk.
* Not enough supply, because no one is going to sell OTM calls since they fear the Planet of the Apes.
* Price-gouging: because they know the apes are price-insensitive and need their heroine fix, so just jack up the prices, and the apes won't even know it.  

Do whatever you want, I am rooting for the ape army.  But just be aware that creating a gamma squeeze is harder with the jacked up skew.",1616462407.0

This is a slow moving stock, BUT has several catalysts that should easily make for some quick gains (not financial advice) to roll around in or re-invest in GME/AMC/etc.   This reminds me a bit of the short RKT saga, but I am not suggesting there will be a squeeze, just tendies.  

Catalysts:

\- Ex Dividend Date on 3/30, which means buying the stonk or calls for THIS FRIDAY.   Dividend will then be paid out on 4/30.  This is a REIT with a 10.21 div yield, i.e. very high dividend all things relative, so not a bad place to park your money for a second.

\- Earnings call on 4/26

\- COVID impacts starting to waiver.  NLY is a mortgage REIT, the general consensus seems to be that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, i.e. stonks like this that got hammered are buy opportunities. 

\-Look at the 1 week chart and call prices.  Calls won't get you the dividend and of course are more risky, so buying the stock or playing the options are both viable depending on risk tolerance.

**Tax Receivable Agreement(TRA) and Incremental Loan Warrants, skip this if you're not interested in boring SPAC's tax & loan stuff**

TRA is a common feature in companies that go public via the SPAC route.

Despite it's name, It's mainly a way for the pre-IPO owners to continue to extract value from the new public company even after they've sold all their shares. The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

* **About Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. BCRX, is a commercial-stage *drug developer* headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, that focuses on developing oral therapeutics for *rare diseases*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mlpkmij3blo61.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36de533bb451fca3d6b87830c708ffc3548f236

&#x200B;

* **Unique staff team**

The company was founded in 1996 and is currently led by *Jon P. Stonehouse CEO*, a renowned pharmaceutical executive with over 20 years of thought leadership. Stonehouse previously served as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Merck. Among his numerous accomplishments, Stonehouse was responsible for the game-changing acquisition of Serono S.A in 2007, the largest biotechnology company in Europe at the time.

What makes Jon Stonehouse a unique CEO is the *dedication* he has *towards patients* through his commitment to working faster in order to bring life-saving rare disease therapeutics to patient populations around the world. His passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the [2021 JPM Healthcare Conference](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9)

&#x200B;

* **Institutional ownership**

Apart from having a stellar management team, what prospective retail investors should also pay close attention to is BioCryst‚Äôs rockstar institutional investor syndicate, which includes both generalist industry stalwarts such as *State Street/BlackRock* and sector-specialist biotech funds like *Baker Brothers/Sarissa Capital*. Making institutions reach to own [78.77%](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=BCRX&subView=institutional) of the company.

&#x200B;

What should catch investors attention is *Alex Denner*, head of *Sarissa Capital Management* recently increasing his stake in the company, managing to own 5% of it. He is one of the most well known biotech investors in the industry. He is the largest inside shareholder of Biogen pharma, ticker *BIIB*, and notorious for not only finding incredibly deep value in preclinical companies, but for being an ""active"" vs passive role in their success.

After taking large positions in his value finds, he becomes an advocate for high level decisions from management that unlock shareholder value. He speaks up against possible bad M&A deals and has been known to bring two companies together to facilitate other deals.

**‚óã Orladeyo** ‚Ñ¢ **(berotralstat) oral pill**

Orladeyo is the *first Oral approved* treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with *hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect *1 in 50,000 people*.

Berotralstat is currently approved in two countries. On December the 3rd it got approved by the FDA in the *USA*, and on January the 22nd in *Japan*. The company expects approval of Orladeyo in *Europe* to happen early Q2.

Before oral Orladeyo was approved for HAE, patients would only have treatments that required usage of *needles*. This dramatically reduced the *quality of their life*, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main reason why Orladeyo is a game changer.

After the approval, surveys on patients were done, showing a large number of new patients that were not treated before due to needles, now willing to be treated taking oral form Orladeyo pills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As it's shown in [the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 13), in their recently undergone survey, 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, and that number rised to 71% with Physician recommendation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wbybla3ablo61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=c24a00de5386cb0f589b746b7e1555e9768c0dc1

&#x200B;

Additional surveys were undergone on patients using treatments from the competence ""Cynrize, Haegarda, Takhzyro"" and the results were [the following ones](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 14).

&#x200B;

**Number of Patients**

**USA**

In the USA there are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over [41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients.

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals.

A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

After Orladeyo received the approval in Japan, Goichi Matsuda, president of Torii said the following words ""Until now, HAE patients in Japan had no therapies approved to prevent attacks, so the approval of Orladeyo marks a significant advance in HAE treatment"", ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to bring the first oral treatment option to Japanese HAE patients and are actively preparing for the commercialization"".

Japan has 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients this year.

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over [41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe

**Pricings/Revenue**

Each patient will have to pay 485K/year to access the drug in USA. In Japan and Europe the pricing system changes since pricing and jurisdictions work in a different way there. Making it 200K/year.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$

Japan - 500p x 200K = 100,000,000$

EU - 4,920p x 200K = 984,000,000$

Summing it all up we get 2,575,375,000$. From that number we have to subtract 74,625,000$ making it a total of 2,500,750,000$. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreements with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

In the following [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-EvTE-yoFQo9b7iKT5RAZ0jRpnrrQjCN0uI21UhuA4M/edit#gid=1287547342), you will have access to a google sheet, where yearly revenues generated by Orladeyo is estimated. A wide range of multipliers regarding the total patient pool that Orladeyo could capture is added, ranging from ( 10%, 20%, 41% and 75%).Revenues have been estimated with the actual price of Orladeyo in 2021 485K/year, it also has an estimation looking forward to 2025, on how the price of the drug will rise due to inflation. Finally there is a chart that gives an idea of what the the market cap could reach to be using revenue multipliers.

**Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating 2,500,750,000$ a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of 17,505,250,000$, meaning an increase of 99.40$ in the stock price.

**‚óã Peramivir** ‚Ñ¢ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Rapivab is a bio-defense drug that is often stockpiled by the government. Last time being September the 26th, with a purchase of $14 million.

**Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $750,000,000 conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**‚óã Galidesivir - BCX4430**

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. Recently, the 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Besides COVID-19, the world suffers from 200 million infections per year from filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg), flaviviruses (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, picornaviruses and paramyxoviruses (think RSV). Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

**Efficacy**

Phase I safety trials in humans had shown that it was safe and well tolerated .NIAID on April 9th 2020 its expansion of the Brazilian yellow fever trial to include three cohorts of 8 severely affected COVID-19 patients, each being given a different IV dose regimen . Unfortunately, but obvious in hindsight, this trial was from the beginning underpowered to determine a clinical benefit. The patients were followed for eight weeks after their treatments. The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, which will likely be published shortly, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage. Despite all this and even though the trial was not even powered to detect a clinical difference in the patients, the NIAID, after finding an insignificant difference in outcomes between the small numbers of drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, inexplicably decided to discontinue clinical trials of it for COVID-19, to the great confused dismay of investors and perhaps even taken advantage of by short hedge funds who brought the stock down in late December. Bear in mind that during this trial, one of the most lethal strains of COVID-19 we know of was affecting the Brazilian trial sites, later known now as the P.1 or Manaus strain, and could have easily negatively affected the clinical outcomes of this small trial too given that the trial was focused on very sick patients more likely to carry this bad strain.

**Galidesivir value**

First of all, we must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the explanations being given, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $2.5B, this is 14.20$.

**‚óã FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren‚Äôt any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

‚ÄúBCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.‚Äù

**BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.426$

**‚óã Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D currently in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

&#x200B;

**Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the following words.

‚ÄúEmbarrassment of riches‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one‚Äù , ‚ÄúMy only concern is i have no concerns‚Äù, ‚ÄúPipeline in a molecule‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is Big‚Äù.

&#x200B;

**Efficacy level**

The key for efficacy with this kind of treatment is improving the number of Hb Hemoglobin levels. [BCX9930 showed 3.8g/dL improvement](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 31 ). The competence, Novartis showed 2.87g/dL improvement and Alexion 2.4-2.6g/dL.

On December the 6th, 2020 BCX9930 data was released showing high potency and specificity for alternative pathway complement.

‚ÄúBCX9930 monotherapy has the potential to inhibit both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis‚Äù,

‚ÄúIn the study, BCX9930 was highly specific for the alternative pathway and, after oral dosing of BCX9930 in primates, alternative pathway activity was completely suppressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese data demonstrate that BCX9930 is a highly potent and specific orally bioavailable Factor D inhibitor with potential for treatment of patients with PNH and other alternative pathway mediated diseases,‚Äù said Dr. William Sheridan‚Äù

**Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 be a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to [8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ‚ÄúPipeline in a molecule‚Äù. The diseases it treats are the following ones.

https://preview.redd.it/ggnn319fblo61.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=531ed8987a7c843221a7ed74cbe4ea7a342cda92

PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

Lupus Nephritis

IgAN vasculitis

C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

**Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat those diseases, we reach the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to 44.53B/year. Being that number obtained summing up the following ones.

‚Äú""PNH Treatment Market Size Worth $5.8 Billion by 2025""

‚Äú""The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025""

‚Äú""aHUS, having in mind the disease prevalence (2 and 5.5)/MM, and the disease being treated with Soliris - 500,000$/ year. The worldwide market size should range between ( $7.5B and $20.5B)"" We take 7.5B as conservative.

‚Äú""Vasculitis treatment market size forecast to reach $743.2M by 2025""

‚Äú""IgAN, having in mind the 1/3,707 incidence rate, and the yearly cost of the drug $12,456 we are aiming for a market size of $4,660,088,544""

‚Äú""Having in mind C3G can be treated with Soliris and it costs $500,000 a year. Summing up all those 45,700 patients the market size we aim for is 22.85B""

All this data can be more detailedly found in the following [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-EvTE-yoFQo9b7iKT5RAZ0jRpnrrQjCN0uI21UhuA4M/edit#gid=1287547342) mentioned before.

&#x200B;

**Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue comes from their ‚Äú""Factor D""‚Äù C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter?. Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion‚Äôs, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is.

Apart from the buy out, i think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's factor D when it was in ph 2 for $930MM.

In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS¬Æ (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH adn aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 6 diseases more, aimming for a wider market size, and also having greater efficacy/safety.

Using a biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier 3,964B = 27,748B. meanning a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, this numbers could go much higher.

&#x200B;

**Phase II study**

Despite the company not PR'ing the start of the phase II study of BCX9930, the official page of [clinacal trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04702568), show that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it reasures our thoughts that Ph I data readout will be good and enough to keep the study going.

&#x200B;

**BCX9930 Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that BCX9930 will be advancing to pivotal trials in PNH following the successful proof of conecpt trial.

The company announced that the Pivotal trials in PNH and proof of concept trials in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021.

A pivotal trial is typically a Phase III clinical trial in the multi-year process of clinical research intended to demonstrate and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treat. A successful pivotal trial is required as evidence for drug marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

* Phase I trial key data

"" Through their last study visit, 100 percent of treatment-na√Øve patients and 83 percent of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were *transfusion-free*. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-na√Øve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

"" Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-na√Øve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2¬†g/dL, respectively ""

"" Relative red blood cell clone size, a marker of hemolytic control, also increased from 53 to 92 percent in treatment-na√Øve patients and from 50 to 80 percent in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients ""

"" C3 opsonization, a key marker of extravascular hemolysis, declined to less than two percent by the eight-week visit in five of six C5 inadequate response patients following BCX9930 therapy ""

"" In C5 inhibitor na√Øve patients, clinical chemistry biomarkers of intravascular hemolysis, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin, all declined. Mean LDH x ULN declined by 73 percent from 7.5x ULN at baseline to 2.0x ULN ""

&#x200B;

**BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential best-in-class treatment, Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their ‚ÄúFactor D‚Äù c5 inhibitor and the yearly market size it aims for in 2025 rounds 44.53B. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion‚Äôs buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$. I want to make clear that once the drug is approved and generating revenue, the average x7 revenue can be used, making it much more valuable than it‚Äôs now. Do not forget data readout is due Q1.

* **BCX9930 value:** **66.44$ SP**

&#x200B;

**Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is. After recently increasing his stake in BCRX, along with BlackRock, he now owns a 5.01% of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789% in the last 3 quarters, showing strong conviction in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than an strong BO candidate. A buy out coming from BIIB, company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors, would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase II data is unveiled.

&#x200B;

* **Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion pharmaceuticals has a Factor D ""c5"" inhibitor called Soliris.

This company could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's performance. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size they captured got wider.

&#x200B;

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX at least expects to generate 500 MM with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any more money risings ""offerings"".

Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

&#x200B;

* **Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued at 184.74$. The StockPrice number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues flow in, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.

I currently do own a position in this company, my average entry price being around 4.25$. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",1616452392.0

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¬¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¬¢ more, the buyer gets 3¬¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¬¢ instead of 8¬¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/01 - Close: $120.40

3/02 - Close: $118.18

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

56,The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on Volkswagen,741,maiolz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maiolz/the_arbitrage_michael_burry_trade_on_volkswagen/,198,"Michael Burry said **‚ÄúI don‚Äôt own a Porsche, but I own the Porsche that owns VW that owns Porsche‚Äù**. Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.

**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**

* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.
* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% 
* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)
* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE‚Äôs current market-cap.
* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. 
* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.
* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn‚Äôt fixed.
* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.

&#x200B;

Volkswagen recently had their own type of ""battery day"" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. 

TLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.

61,RKT's growth story shows up in its financials,242,macryp,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/,85,"I see many people compare RKT's forward P/E of around 12 to supposed peers like COF (Forward P/E 9.25), ESNT (7.38), PFSI (5.45), WD (12.2), UWMC (6.83), and claim that RKT is fairly valued or even overvalued. But I think that is a shallow comparison, given that [RKT is more than just a pureplay mortgage company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/). So what are some other metrics that we can use to compare these companies? One way is to also check their P/S, which is used a lot for growth companies that sometimes have losses and does not have a proper P/E. RKT has a P/S of 2.87, with a $45B market cap on $16B sales; what about these pure-play mortgage company peers?

COF - 2.26

ESNT - 5.24

PFSI - 0.99

WD - 3.14

UWMC - 3.99

So you can see here that RKT is middle of the pack. Why is it that RKT has average P/S valuation but high P/E valuation? The difference here is in spending - the higher expenses of RKT is making the EPS lower. What is RKT spending on and why does the spending make RKT stand out? They are reinvesting in the business - buying marketing, spending for infrastructure (they have a 2500 software team, larger than any of these other companies), acquiring other businesses, etc. You might argue and say maybe RKT is really inefficient and has a bunch of useless employees? Lets quickly check this: RKT has 20,000 employees and $16B sales, UWMC has 7000 employees and $3.62 sales, COF has 52,000 employees and $26B sales... you get the idea, RKT is pretty efficient with their staff.

So in the end, it's clear that based on sales, RKT is not overvalued. Their high P/E ratio is because they are reinvesting in the company, just as a growth company would do. Their investment in infrastructure and automation already clearly shows up in their staff efficiency.",1616409200.0

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven‚Äôt blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you‚Äôre down, that‚Äôs understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we‚Äôve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It‚Äôs like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It‚Äôs gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it‚Äôll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don‚Äôt worry. Basics are super simple and I won‚Äôt confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you‚Äôre not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I‚Äôm sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we‚Äôre going to cover today.

You‚Äôre gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

Let‚Äôs step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We‚Äôre gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it‚Äôs 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we‚Äôre going to add to our chart what‚Äôs proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. ü§Ø

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There‚Äôs a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we‚Äôre seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that‚Äôs a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here‚Äôs the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. ‚ÄúIf I were to hold two more days, I could‚Äôve doubled my money‚Äù.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it‚Äôs close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would‚Äôve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don‚Äôt look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We‚Äôre stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It‚Äôs simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I‚Äôm not touching TSLA. I‚Äôm not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That‚Äôs gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, ‚ÄúShit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?‚Äù

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It‚Äôs a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

64,DD Boomer Edition:Canadian Pacific to Merge with Kansas City Railroad. üöÇ I am autistic so I like the trains.,264,mabg4o,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabg4o/dd_boomer_editioncanadian_pacific_to_merge_with/,82,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/railroads-strike-a-25-billion-merger-11616330332

Canadian Pacific has been trying to make a major purchase of a US railroad for years that would allow them a clean path between Mexico and Canada.  They want badly to be the USMCA railroad and have been put down by regulators multiple times despite raising cash for huge companies like Norfolk Southern.

US regulators have been blocking it because their buyouts would have arguably reduced market options and railroads are the one piece of semi-public assets the US still seems to be on board with protecting.  This small $25 billion dollar deal resolves the problem because instead of picking up a major rail network Canadian Pacific brokered a deal with a short line  ü©≥‚ûñrailroad service.  

In this case the Kansas City Southern is a very limited route with half of it's rail in mexico and it's US rail being simple long isolated stretches rather than the web a company like Norfolk provides.  So the primary regulatory concern is gone and from an international trade standpoint this would actually be a win.

Other Factors: 

Railroads are good recovery stocks.  Supply lines and distribution are a mess with back logs right now.  Ports are backed up, raw materials are missing and Texas getting shutdown by the storm hit a number of industries in that area hard.  Rail lines provide the ability to move large amounts of freight at lower prices than any other method on the globe.  

Railways are also increasingly green technology.  They were already the most efficient transportation method on the market but the technology keeps improving and railways has lots of incentive to adapt as energy costs are one of the major factors in their profits.  This means the industry likely doesn't see any pain coming out of the Biden administration and can likely get a piece of an alleged infrastructure bill.

Boomer Points:

Railways give dividends!  Thats extra money in your pocket.  Great secure industry that isn't going anywhere.  Millennials may be afraid of üöÇ but they need trains to move ü•ëüçû and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.   Rail is secure and GROWING.  

Railways are simple and easy to understand.  People need to move things and üöÇ are üí™ alone.  

This would literally be a new transcontinental railroad just in the other direction!  It is üöÇ history in the making!

Warnings : The last two merger attempts by CP failed.  This is their third shot at an end goal of getting direct access lines tied together between the USMCA counties.  Probably the most likely to succeed but no guarantee.

Rail is slow and that makes it vulnerable to other developments in the transit market (see self driving electric trucks).  The market is strong and showing promise but needs to push it's own technology forward to remain competitive long term.  Not to say they aren't trying but the auto industry has way more Engineers.

Positions;. Currently none.  Merger was announced today.  Calls are pricey but I'm going to try to buy in early Monday.  Rail is actually beating the market anyway.",1616405066.0

Marathon Oil (MRO)

In recent trends I have noticed the huge ups and downs with the Big Oil Companies. Only 2 within the energy sector stand out. The main one that I find that still has plenty of value you is MRO and it is flush with cash. Presently MRO has 742 Million cash on hand and pays a reasonable dividend. 

Dividend Yield / Amount

Dividend

The dividend shown represents the issuer's standard recurring dividend and does not reflect any special dividends.

Ex-Dividend Date

02/16/2021

Dividend Payable Date

03/10/2021

Next Earnings Date

05/05/2021

If you compare this to COP or CONOCO-PHILLIPS, MRO / Marathon is cheap and actually oversold. It is true the Marathon Oil has a main office in Findlay, Ohio and that is about 45 minutes from me. So, I am all for the local people. It is also true that in 2019 that MRO was over $20.00 a share. 

And I quote as far as cash is concerned 

‚ÄúThe latest balance sheet data shows that Marathon Oil had liabilities of US$1.07b due within a year, and liabilities of US$6.33b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$522.0m in cash and US$620.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So, its liabilities total US$6.25b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.‚Äù (Simply Wall St 2020). 

This will improve by years end as MRO and the entire sector has seen increase in the price per barrel Brent Sea Crude as high as 70.00 a barrel. It is expected that Oil will be closer to $80.00 a barrel by the end of Summer as people are tired of the hole BS Covid thing and have decided to just get out and go. Presently Brent Sea Crude is trading at about $63.00 a barrel. As I previously said this will ultimately increase profits for MRO (Marathon). But presently MRO last traded at 11.02 a share and I have seen a lot of activity for April 09th Call options with a strike price of $14.00 a share, and at that level the Implied Volatility is around 77%, meaning it can either got to $14 a share of go to $0.

Also, and I hate to say this but Neal Dingmann at Truist Financial has his price target at $15.00 a share. If I were to follow him. It would reinforce my theory that MRO is not only a Value play, but WAY OVER SOLD!!! I know you APE will down vote this as you always do. So, it is expected, but half of you apes will end up going out and buying shares after down voting it. But facts are facts and if I read everything correctly MRO(Marathon) had a 40% upside earnings surprise. Also, as I quote ‚ÄúBased on its pre-COVID enterprise value to PV-10 premium, MRO shares might have more than 30% upside given where WTI stands today.‚Äù (Seeking Alpha as of 19 March 2021). It seems the shorts/bears want this want at $10.00 a share and the short interest is only about 6% of the total shares outstanding. Just remember I look for cheap STONKS that are oversold and are flush with Tendies$$$$$. I am not telling you to buy anything, and I do not work for MRO, and this is not advice. I will add that the MAE(Moving Average Envelope) is showing an upward trend in the chart. So do your own DD, like I did, and on what little free time I have and take a look for yourself. I don‚Äôt claim to know shyte! I do know cheap, and I do like $$$GAINZ. Also, I will add this, if somehow magically MRO gets to $15.00 a share by the 1st of April, I will eat a wrecking ball pepper and show proof via video.

$GME -25% 3/19 EOW

# Rambling OPINION PIECE, skip if you just want the calculator

It's been two weeks with over 70% correlation between gamma and price. Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for ü¶çü¶çü¶ç to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.

Some important points

1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.
2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.
3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.
4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\_was\_the\_footprint\_of\_institutional\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)
5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.
6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate

I believe if ü¶çü¶çü¶ç understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   üçå to it, ü¶çü¶çü¶ç together  üí™ , ü¶çü¶çü¶ç + üß† = mega  üçåüçå üçå

# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8

This update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders

The calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include

* Current Price
* Projected Price
* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)
* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)
* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date

The new graph simulator graph has the following controls

https://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e

That allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a

From the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while üåàüêª buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.

By clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price

https://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571

From the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.

To find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge

https://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a

To find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest

https://preview.redd.it/yb8j1jdu8ho61.jpg?width=1315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6495f3c8ea70a1a543a62a3d03bcda5cd75b3d8

You can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).

To model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.

https://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448

change the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067

https://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4

You'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.

On the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.

https://preview.redd.it/r74sn5ud9ho61.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae17addc9f5cf1d9c1dac73343fbb2847524f00

Gamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV

# Obligatory harebrained scheme

If all ü¶çü¶çü¶ç understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.

*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling ü¶çü¶çü¶ç to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if ü¶ç did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*

For this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  üíéü§≤ , I suggest ü¶çü¶çü¶ç wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, ü¶çü¶çü¶ç can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.

Summarizing, the steps are

1. üíéü§≤  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week
2. Wait for IV <200%
3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio
4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting üçåüçåüçås. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *ü¶çü¶çü¶ç* together or the play won't work
5. Watch price goes up end of week
6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain
7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes
8. Witness short hedgies cry
9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse
10. Profit !!!

Firstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.

Second, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.

Third, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.

Fourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?

Fifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?

Finally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.

I see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.

1. **The price of a number of other stocks that Melvin Capital held short positions in closely correlate with GME's. It's not just AMC/GME. (BBBY, IRBT, FIZZ and GSX)**
2. **Melvin Capital held put positions in these tickers but closed them during Q4 of 2020, before all of them went through a period of volatility along with GME.** 
3. **MC hold a put position in $AG, a silver mining company that was shilled on WSB during the 'silver squeeze' bullshit, which also followed a similiar pattern to GME in January with a rapid run-up around the 27th January.** 

Link to Melvin Capital 13F filings i.e. MC's holdings, use the 'quarter to view' drop-down to select which quarter to view. 

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)

From that you can view or download an excel file of MC's holdings - up to Q4 of 2020. 

Back at the end of January I was looking at the day's biggest movers on yahoo, and noticed that a few silver mining companies had gone up by around 20-25%.  This was at the time that all that bullshit about a 'silver squeeze' was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole 'silver squeeze' thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day's other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.

Like I say, what I did was go through that day's (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F's have been made available. I'll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. 

&#x200B;

As you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn't demonstrate causation however: the point I'm making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can't really be put down to just general market trends. 

Now, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.

**$BBBY**

MC position as of Q3 13F:

PUT. Market value: $48,385,000. Also their 69th biggest holding. Nice. 

Another interesting thing about $BBBY is this:

Cramer made a couple tweets about BBBY and linked them to WSB. Pretty sure there's one where he actually tried to driect WSB's attention to BBBY but I can't find it.

**$IRBT**

MC held a $37,950,000 market value PUT according to 13F filings for Q3. 

**$GSX**

MC held a  $54,408,000 put position. 

**Finally, $AG**

https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0

Now, I can't find any AG position for MC in Q3, however for Q4, they added an entirely new position. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11

That's a brand new put position in the 4th quarter of 2020 worth $74m USD. If anyone has got the ticker mention data I think it would be really interesting to see the ticker mentions of things like $SLV and $AG around this period. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now to cover the Q3 vs Q4 filings, below are the Q4 statements for the previous tickers  that I stated MC held put positions in for Q3:

So there was a correlation between GME and a number of other stocks that MC held short positions in as of Q3 of 2020, but they abruptly closed these positions out in Q4, before the volatility early in Q1 of 2021. 

**So to summarise:** 

1. There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their **Q3** 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. 
2. According to Melvin Capital's  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions *before* the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. 
3. MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it's peak. The consensus at the time was that the 'silver squeeze' was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. 

There are probably other tickers that could fit here that I've missed too. 

**So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?**

Could MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? 

Once the Q1 2020 13F's are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it's up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there's something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward. After all, if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters eventually they'll write some Shakespeare.",1616398682.0

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

Currently, I only have one TSLA $687.5c 3/26e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

81,Target Q1 Earnings will crush it,117,ma5xpr,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma5xpr/target_q1_earnings_will_crush_it/,50,"Q4 for Target wasn‚Äôt too hot I‚Äôll admit. Got crushed playing earnings on the stock for the first time holding through the results. But I believe that Q1 will be vastly different. Q4 had loads of holidays sales, meaning profit margins were down. They also gave more hours to employees to keep up with the demand... but here‚Äôs the kicker. Demand isn‚Äôt slowing at all but hours are down. Plus no holiday sales. The Karens and various other creatures that prowl Target are now locked n loaded with stimulus checks. Just go to your local target bruh. It‚Äôs packed as shit and they‚Äôve got maybe like 2-3 people on the registers. Cutting costs, no big sales cutting margins, and a steady flow of people stampeding to go into target will cause a massive earnings beat in May when they report again. So you might be wondering... ‚Äúokay so we‚Äôre probably 2 months away from the next earnings report isn‚Äôt this priced in or will be priced in?‚Äù 

Probably not. I predict Target will eclipse 200 and trade sideways until they report earnings in May. Even if they are above 200 when they report.. I think loading up post earnings calls 5-10% OTM will print nicely for anyone brave enough to take them. 

I don‚Äôt know how much attention this post will get because WallStreetBets has changed a lot lol. All I see is gamestonk this amc that. That‚Äôs what happens when a bunch of normies invade a Sub-Reddit that used to actually have lots of good investment/yolo ideas that were backed by decent fundamentals. 

TLDR:

TGT is loved by Karens and people spend all their money there idk why. Buy 5-10% OTM calls post earnings in May

EDIT: I currently own 4 195/200 July 16 bull spreads and plan on grabbing May/July calls as it gets closer to Q1 earnings",1616388921.0

They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.

I recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn‚Äôt illogical and that Cathie wasn‚Äôt crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong.

Now just to be clear, I‚Äôm not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.

**P/E. It‚Äôs over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**

P/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?

Let‚Äôs step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we‚Äôd expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart‚Äôs 28 and Costco‚Äôs 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).

On the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.

P/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn‚Äôt account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you‚Äôd still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively ‚Äúinflated‚Äù P/E.

That said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there‚Äôs no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.

**Forward P/E**

While Tesla‚Äôs trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock‚Äôs market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company‚Äôs estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.

Comparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it‚Äôs positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don‚Äôt expect to be profitable within the next year.

And while Tesla‚Äôs P/E is high it‚Äôs difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they‚Äôre not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn‚Äôt another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.

That said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won‚Äôt be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.

**Price-to-sales**

If a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren‚Äôt part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.

TSLA‚Äôs price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn‚Äôt have sales yet. It‚Äôs quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company‚Äôs expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it‚Äôs in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.

**A historical example**

Another common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don‚Äôt pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I‚Äôm certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you‚Äôd get the last laugh.

So let‚Äôs look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO‚Äôd in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.

If we take Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla‚Äôs price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.

**Market cap**

One last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla‚Äôs market cap is quite high as it‚Äôs already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).
The global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla‚Äôs share price ~4.5Xing.

**Tl;dr**

While Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.

Like any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.

Please ~~bear~~ bull with me, because this will be long. Some of you have probably seen my other posts and this will be much the same; however, this technical analysis will be more in-depth and will cover a wider ranger of indicators than previous posts. I am a technical trader and these are the indicators that I have used in the past and that I have found helpful, but this is in no way exhaustive and there are many other indicators and trading styles that are just as useful as these.

**Volume - catalysts**

I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:

https://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e

&#x200B;

Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase."" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:

https://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7

&#x200B;

The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like ""ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button""). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:

https://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189

https://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601

&#x200B;

So, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of ""the squeeze might happen here"" or ""the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming"" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.

**OBV**

""But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes."" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba

&#x200B;

So what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.

So, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.

**SPY and VIX**

Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):

Though the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.

In this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.

**Current patterns**

Looking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:

https://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da

&#x200B;

As you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26

&#x200B;

That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42

As you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:

**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**

Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e

The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:

https://preview.redd.it/i1bonxi3sfo61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0067ba6738df71b367ff56765f3fbb6de790e53

These three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.

**A note about the ""short attacks""**

As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**

The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**A Note about squeezes**

Before I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.

**Why short interest might not matter**

If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.

**FTD Squeeze**

I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.

**Closing Thots**

In short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account. I have always loved investing and trading, but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy. Thanks a ton apes, stay strong.",1616385434.0
86,"PLTR Analyst Ratings - FUD, Bad Faith and abusing their analyst positions",694,ma4b3b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4b3b/pltr_analyst_ratings_fud_bad_faith_and_abusing/,211,"So I was doing my DD on PLTR today and whilst going over the ownership structure and Shareholder History I did see some amusing things - I say ""amusing"" when I'm really fuming. No need to be creative and interpret anything on this one - it doesn't get any clearer than this.

1.) Some of you might've seen the **Credit Suisse and William Blair Analyst Ratings for PLTR** \- Underperform with a Price Target of 20 as of February 16th 2021 (Reviewed and unchanged as of March 15th). Note that both those ratings were issued after the FY 2020 report dropped - so after seeing the 47% increase in revenues.

[The 2 Underperform Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/172gxd93lfo61.png?width=1404&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b4448e07eef9f839a156716e982e53f14db92849)

2.) Now guess who loaded up massively on PLTR shares for the last reporting date. I'm talking the **BIGGEST** relative position increase for the last reporting date - they didn't just double or tripple down, they quintupled down. Unfortunately I can't get the exact number of shares - but my best guess is that it's an Overweight position at this point (Edit: It makes up for 21% of CS Asset Management LLC‚Äòs portfolio - Check Edit 2 - wowzaaaa)

[Credit Suisse with the BIGGEST relative position increase in the last reporting period - PLTR is CS Asset Management LLC‚Äòs biggest position accounting for 21&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#37; of their Portfolio \(Check Edit 2 for more on that\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ci8uk87lfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=26d896e80c2f8fde57ad285d6f064a1c7e149181)

Now - in which subsidiary of Credit Suisse does said analyst Chew, Yaoxian work?

[He's a VP at Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC \(US\) - yep](https://preview.redd.it/zlfu1bxdlfo61.png?width=1819&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3ddbd45cd5ab4121ad880669fb51f4570bd19d30)

Little sidenote: If you had invested based on mister Chew's analysis, you would've made a whopping -8% return for the past 3 years! *Blacklisted the guy.*

Mister Bhavan's ratings don't look a lot better.

If you're reading this Chew - shame on you and if you wanna boost your accuracy and recommendation performance - maybe do your job and post an actual analysis, not just one that serves to spread negative sentiment in the hopes of lowering your cost basis. I bet you don't give two shits about actually doing your job though.

3.) Now let's have a look at William Blair's trades.

[No comment](https://preview.redd.it/3nbo9hmemfo61.png?width=1118&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=8cdc305208a842b497abb06c9a253501621be67f)

[Bhavan Suri's Ratings not looking too rosy either.](https://preview.redd.it/74w7rwxamfo61.png?width=1796&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=0d31456fba6a1716e9ab971fdccc01bb0fdfa536)

Let's have a look at William Blair's disclosure:

Officers and employees of William Blair or its affiliates (other than research analysts) mayhave a financial interest in the securities of Palantir Technologies Inc.. 

**(NO SHIT)**

This whole thing is just bullshit and I seriously question why these guys are even allowed to issue forecasts.

**TLDR:** 
CS and William Blair analysts are issuing sell/underperform ratings while massively loading up on PLTR stonks.

The only analysts I trust on this one are the GS analysts - the rest are full of BS, giving Sell recommendations while loading up on the respective stonks themselves. If you issue a sell recommendation, well then at least put your money where your mouth is. Not like mister Chew was just some low tier analyst who couldn't affect the decision of his firm to buy or sell PLTR shares - he's a VP at CS USA LLC - Chinese wall, my ass. **Their DDs and PTs are literally worthless.** Do your own DD, don't even look at the analyst ratings or if you do, look at their track record and question if they're pursuing some alterior motive. 
I've literally seen DDs on WSB that have been more accurate than these *professional* forecasts. This just goes to show that these guys are just trying to load up on more stonks at a lower cost basis by spreading negative sentiment. It's infuriating - I am legitimately pissed and hope that more people see this blatant bullshittery.

[At least Goldman gives honest ratings and their actions are in line with the recommendations they issue. - Issue a buy rating - load up on stonks. Issue a sell rating - sell the stonks. How fucking hard can it be.](https://preview.redd.it/zi72enzenfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3201e3eeb872eedba58f33ce9e1a797e240051b5)

**Edit: Valuation Concerns**

I see some people saying they're currently grossly over-valued. If compared to some of their peers I'd disagree, there might be some inflation but that's due to future expectations. 47% Sale's Growth last year, IBM partnering up with PLTR is bigger than it may sound at first glance - IBM has been in the game for decades and surely have the resources to create some beautiful things but they've given up competing against PLTR.

[If you look at the recently listed peers \(Snowflake, Datadog, Dynatrace\) - they're not as grossly overvalued as one might think given the hype they've gotten recently. They just have to \\""grow\\"" into that market cap and beyond, which I have no doubt they will. Also have a look at the EPS - the recently listed ones \(except for Dynatrace\) all have negative EPS \(PLTR in fact did have positive earnings at one point, but they're just re-investing everything and growing aggressively\).](https://preview.redd.it/vgmc4kiq2go61.png?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=6c0e3bf371c8d6fbc921d51905d710463af3fa82)

Also: if you deduct the stock based compensation from FY2020‚Äòs net loss (which is sound as it‚Äòs not a recurring cost), they‚Äòve actually netted a profit. I might do a more extensive DD on the Financials and have a deeper look into the shareholder‚Äòs portfolios to show the conviction of the individual shareholders.

If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first company to ever get that level of clearance. That would attract other governments like the UK, France, Germany etc. (I bet some of those are already in discussions with PLTR). Government Contracts made up for around 50% of revenues last year. So even more revenue growth and more partnerships (which means higher revenue stability). They're also expanding into the private sector. I see a lot of upside but given the current market environment (high treasury yields - uncertainty about future inflation developments...) it might take a while.

u/Ada_Diamonds did a [great DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) on the future potential of PLTR - so just check that one out. It's not very financy, more from a practical PoV which imo makes more sense in valuating these companies - no way you'd value TSLA, PLTR, SNOW etc. with your traditional DCF/Multiples methods.

**Edit 2 - CS Securities USA and William Blair - Broker-Dealer/MM role:**

u/McKoijion brought up a fair point in saying that the aforementioned Credit Suisse subsidiary has a broker dealer role and hence does not hold those stonks to profit from them, they hold them to facilitate trade - which is partly true. The shares were acquired via Credit Suisse Securities and are currently held by CS Asset Management LLC who have a Low turnover rate (meaning they usually hold securities for a long period of time). Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC is the top 20th Institutional Shareholder. Their biggest position is PLTR (21% - the next largest position is ~10%, now that‚Äôs some insitutional YOLO like I‚Äôve never seen it before. Obviously they‚Äôll trade some shares to the other CS subsidiaries, I don‚Äôt expect them to have 20% of their portfolio in PLTR when the next filings get released). That imo has nothing to do with them being PLTR's IPO partners alongside GS and MS - neither GS nor MS have that weighting on PLTR stock.

[Credit Suisse Asset Management - top 20 institutional holder](https://preview.redd.it/lg08skyt4go61.png?width=381&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b397365437263c8d1ddb7917a702ea0aa60d2ace)

As to William Blair - They're an actual Asset Manager, no MM or Broker-Dealer role there - pretty straightforward, they're just holding.

I don‚Äôt know the long-term ramifications of NLY, but what I do know is that it hasn't hit its peak and has the potential to at least be moved to twice what it's at right now by seeing its current trajectory and its former high. I also did a little research on the company

It‚Äôs a mortgage that pays out dividends to its stock owners (much like the RKT play) except as shown here, it had an insanely good 4th quarter-

A reminder that this isn't my long-play, that would be GME...but I do like this stock too  üëÄ

But every day since the quarter results have been announced it's been increasing in price exponentially, so I have an inkling that by at least EOW (especially with WSB attention) it could be at 9.50,10$.

‚ÄúBut Jester, it‚Äôs at $8.95 right now, that's not that much movement???‚Äù

THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE IT GETS FUCKIN JUICY BROS.

LOOK AT THESE CALL PRICES.

&#x200B;

0.05 for 9$ call when it's only fucking 8.95 right now, that's where this post has been going, this is a fucking 10bagger if the price shoots up this week with added volatility. For whatever reason, the premiums have not been catching up with the actual price and they've stayed very low for even ITM calls. 

But I get it. You want to play it safe, which is exactly why I think just purchasing the stock itself is a nice modest gain you can get for this week, yeah the stock isn‚Äôt going to shoot up to fuckin- 20, 30$ i don‚Äôt think. But going up 4-5$ is also insanely good and is better than getting cucked by stocks you think are going to go up 20-30$ only just to get slapped down a couple of bucks. (I‚Äôm looking at you UWMC) I wish no ill will to UWMC folk btw, but hot damn do I keep getting bested by that bad boy.

93,DD 4 SQ,57,ma1gq0,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma1gq0/dd_4_sq/,22,"On 4 March, 2021, narrow-moat Square announced that it will buy a majority stake in music platform Tidal for $297 million
in cash and stock. As part of the deal, Tidal board member and shareholder Jay-Z is expected to join
Square‚Äôs board. Much of Cash App‚Äôs recent success has come from Square‚Äôs efforts to build
out ancillary services on the platform, and this could provide another tie-in. However, in this case, the
strategic connection seems fairly weak, and Tidal is expected to continue to operate independently.
Square's comments on the deal suggest that the acquisition will provide a further entry point to serve
the music industry, so there could be some opportunities on the acquiring side as well. Still, the deal is
much too small to have a material impact on the $78 fair value estimate by experts.

üöÄ

Square‚Äôs business model, characterized by efficient client onboarding, innovative point-of-sale
devices, flat fees, and an internally developed and integrated set of software solutions, allows the
company to reach and retain micro merchants that are unviable for other acquirers. Square's success has largely come from expanding the acquiring market, as opposed to stealing
material share from existing players.
To develop sufficient scale, Square must move past its micro merchant base, and recent results suggest
it is doing just that. At this point, a bit more than half of its payment volume comes from merchants
generating over $125,000 in annual gross payment volume.

üöÄ

Additionally, the company is making significant progress in cross-selling ancillary services, such as
Instant Deposit and Square Capital, into its merchant client base. Tthe move upstream and
cross-selling will allow Square to materially improve margins in the years ahead and show the viability
of its business model. Square is a narrow-moat niche operator, not a disrupter, with market
share limited by its relatively high pricing and long-term margins constrained by its relative lack of scale.
The company's effort to build out a consumer business surrounding its Cash App creates some option
value. However, Square is competing in a space with winner-take-all dynamics, and its competitors
have large consumer customer bases. That said, Cash App's relative performance has been strong,
suggesting it is positioning itself to be a survivor.

üöÄ

Tldr;;

The ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for
acquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other. Ancillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its
merchant client base and improve margins. Electronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square‚Äôs business model looks portable into
international markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.

94,AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.,645,ma1ao9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma1ao9/amc_why_its_all_good_from_fridays_quadruple/,184," 

Why we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.

Here's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.

&#x200B;

[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)

That's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).

This share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.

So Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).

But if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.

If a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.

If this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.

Go AMC, go Apes.

Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.

Related to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.

**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**

Some  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like ""Blaze It  Erryday Co"", ""Kush Money Inc"" and ""Aphria Inc"". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.

Turns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.

Sales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.

I  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.

* ""New"" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.
* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.
* Stonks going to the moon
* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.

Let's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.

**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary ""lifestyle experiences"". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.
* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.
* **Rating: Lol tier**

**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.
* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.
* **Rating: Crayon tier**

**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.
* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.
* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.
* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.
* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**

* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.
* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.
* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.
* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.
* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.
* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.
* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. ""tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY"", okay, right.
* **Rating: Meme tier**

**In conclusion.**

Almost every single company in the ""purely"" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.

Thank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!

I know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.

Currently  I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated  TSLA puts. I am however looking into buying puts on the other EV  companies listed above.",1616370536.0

*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*

Delta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: 

**Dynamic delta hedging** -

Ex: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $11, delta goes to 40%, they buy more. Stock goes down to $9, delta goes to 20%, they sell more. 

This week stock was drifting higher and $14 call sellers are buying more stock while $14 put sellers are ALSO buying. When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let‚Äôs say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let‚Äôs say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.
With the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. 

This week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. At the same time this is happening to the whole options chain. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. 

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn‚Äôt hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.

‚ÄúGamma squeezes‚Äù work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of a $14 call being exercised is dropping. 

**Explaining price action Friday afternoons**:

Ok, so we‚Äôve discussed dynamic delta hedging and how dealers are hedging their exposure constantly. They‚Äôre not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they‚Äôre on the hook for millions of dollars.

Let‚Äôs keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

Dealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they‚Äôve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let‚Äôs say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) 

Reminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral. As the day goes on the dealers short $13.50 calls are buying more stock to get to 100% hedged and the dealers short $14.50 calls are selling more stock to get to 0% hedged.

*(By Friday afternoon having a lot of open interest in higher $ strikes starts to work against longs. ‚ÄúCharm‚Äù is causing the delta on those OTM calls to drop by the minute.)*

The problem for the dealer short the $14 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $13.95 and $14.05  the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It‚Äôs the rate of change of the delta. It‚Äôs changing a lot!)

**Right around $14 it‚Äôs a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn‚Äôt know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won‚Äôt be exercised, they don‚Äôt need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

So. The reason you‚Äôll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) 
b) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions. 

There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry. Generally if dealers are net short vol you‚Äôll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they‚Äôre net long vol you‚Äôll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn‚Äôt the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!) A lot of times a big-ish movement right before the close is dealers capitulating and getting squared to be 100% hedged or 0% hedged. Nobody is leaving their desk Friday afternoon potentially long or short millions of extra shares.

**Max pain theory**- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the ‚Äúmaximum pain‚Äù to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $10 yesterday so it didn‚Äôt totally apply https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/SPY (Don‚Äôt get cute and try to trade off this, you‚Äôll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $14 so while not quite ‚ÄúMax pain,‚Äù the stock ending the day below $14 did cause ‚Äúpain‚Äù to some remaining call holders. GME Max pain was $150, but there was ‚Äúpain‚Äù for remaining $200 put holders.

*It‚Äôs also quite possible that there really was a large natural seller at $14. Again, this is not manipulation.*

**The pin risk ‚Äúproblem‚Äù** revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $13.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers ‚Äúauto-exercise‚Äù any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct ‚ÄúDNE‚Äù- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours. 

*IE, you own a $14 AMC put. Stock closes at $13.93 on Friday and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $20 a share. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù 

*You own a $200 GME call. Stock closes at $200.27 and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that GME is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù
More likely a bunch of idiots bought $200 calls and don‚Äôt have the cash to take delivery so the options aren‚Äôt exercised. 

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. So dealers do have some incentive to push the price to where options won‚Äôt be exercised so they aren‚Äôt taking some weekend risk. The dollars here are small though... it‚Äôs not, ‚Äúif it closes above $200 I‚Äôm screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúif it closes above $200 there‚Äôs still some uncertainty on whether I‚Äôll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I‚Äôm taking some weekend risk.‚Äù **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM. Most options buyers do not exercise.**

On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers. 

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it‚Äôs really very small. And then it‚Äôs a new week and we‚Äôre off to the races again :)

This is my first DD, so go gentle. Okay, so I looked at this on Thursday when it was announced that kid died, and the stock was closer to 100. That said, I still think this has room to grow, and once the price dips again I'm personally going to load up on calls. I think 120 is a good target. I'm on the fence between doing the April or May calls, but I think May is the safer play. 

&#x200B;

Now, I know most DD just has tons of analysis and actual information and walls of text and shit, but here's a pretty chart. 1year chart with bands and the weighted moving average. This says institutional value is at 140, so it's on sale now. Momentum has been dipped, likely from their fucked up logistics. But the stock rose like 8 bucks on the news their treadmill killed a kid, so if that's good enough for the market, that's good enough for me. Let's give Becky a ride, and get in on the PTON action.

&#x200B;

I think there is a good chance their earning call is rough, because my understanding is to unfuck their logistics, they decided to air freight all their hardware to clear the backlog. Sure, selling more bikes is a good thing, but everyone knows logistics is where the money is. So feel free to inverse me with some confidence too.

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

When COVID smacked the world in the teeth OPEC decided to cut oil production by around 10%. Otherwise all the OPEC countries would literally go bust.

2019 oil production was \~101 million barrels per day.

To-date OPEC has still has a 7.5 million barrel cut on oil. Becuase they want to see REAL demand and REAL growth from economies before they increase supply again.

**Let‚Äôs do some intense math: 101-7.5 = 93.5 million barrels per day of current production.**

**Hmmmm**

What is current consumption?

Look at the pretty circle below. Road uses 35.23% of demand for oil in 2019.

Not sure if you can see this next picture but it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAugust 2020 traffic volume trends‚Äù over the years. Obviously during Covid it fell off a cliff as you can see by the blue line below falling off a cliff. It dropped by about 10%.

So I equated that roughly to about 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. This pickup in driving has yet to come back. It has not yet reverted to mean. (average).

&#x200B;

Airline industry next up. Althought airline industry only uses like 8 million barrels of oil per day (out of total pre-COVID of 101) it is still significant.

Pretty chart below shows number of flights per day (thousands). As you can see, pre-COVID it dropped a lot, and now is still down 40%. Which equates to a 3.2 million barrels per day missing that has yet to revert to mean.

# Let‚Äôs summarise:

1. Road 35% (Still needs to revert to mean)
2. Electricity 20% (Stable decline in consumption yearly)
3. Petrochemicals 13.7% (Stable growth in consumption to offset electricty decline)
4. Non-road 11.47% (Don‚Äôt know)
5. Other-sectors 20.6% (partly airline consumption of 8 million barrels per day before crash)

**Current consumption (according to my envelope calculations) =93.62 million barrels**

# So consumption currently ~ production.

We have OPEC who recently got fucked from COVID now waiting for economies to recover. THEN they will increase supply. Imagine you‚Äôre business got reckted, obviously you‚Äôre gonna wanna make back your money before your reduce prices).

# My conclusion?

I think oil is going to hover here 60-70$ Until demand from airlines and roads pickup. THEN OPEC will increase supply, but I don‚Äôt think they will increase supply before.",1616341097.0

105,Palantir: There and Back Again - PT $45 EOFY,875,m9mkzg,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9mkzg/palantir_there_and_back_again_pt_45_eofy/,318,"Hi everyone, this is my take on Palantir. I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.

**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**

I believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we‚Äôre seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:

* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.
* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.
* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.
* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.
* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.
* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.

Note that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.

**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn ‚Äì such growth is not unheard of if you‚Äôve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they‚Äôve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.

&#x200B;

[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)

On another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.

**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.

**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR‚Äôs SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.

&#x200B;

**How long is long-term?** With a stock like Palantir, it seems to be the case that Alex Karp's horizon is beyond 5 years, possibly 6-7 years. The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....

**Key challenges to Palantir:**

We know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:

* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.
* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.
* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.
* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.
* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.

**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**

Price/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.

Thanks everyone for reading this and again I welcome any questions and constructive feedback. Going forward, I'd continue to monitor the stock and might come up with another DD (if anyone has an idea then let me know). One key area that I'd be interested in would be corporate governance and benchmark that against other practices in the software industry.",1616323487.0

Excerpt:

> Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

> It‚Äôs a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling‚Äîthe process of selling shares you don‚Äôt own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‚Äòphantom‚Äô shares‚Äîsurvives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it‚Äôs caused billions of dollars in damage.

> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

Also:

> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

Focus:

> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company‚Äôs share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left.

I‚Äôve just started denting my brain by understanding how Fails to Deliver are hid in Out of the Money calls or puts or whatever and now I got to try and understand Payment for Order Flow?! Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?!

So, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn‚Äôt move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, ‚Äòoh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one‚Äô? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven‚Äôt been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier?

Its starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole?

This is my favorite part of his Wiki.

""Madoff founded a¬†penny stock¬†brokerage¬†in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\[6\]\[7\]¬†The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\[8\]¬†which bypassed ""specialist"" firms by directly executing orders¬†over the counter¬†from retail brokers."" FUCKING GREAT!!!

Then I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard\* who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I‚Äôve been so patiently waiting on.

Any talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time...

I remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF‚Äôs and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don‚Äôt think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven‚Äôt had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF‚Äôs, hidden FTD‚Äôs etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short‚Äôs. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus!

I‚Äôm so angry and frustrated and I don‚Äôt know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I‚Äôm just a homeless filmmaker, aren‚Äôt real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What‚Äôs next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!!

This really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn‚Äôt it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street!

Is every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, ‚Äòhey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff‚Äô.

FUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don‚Äôt know who to trust!

I‚Äôm angry, scared, exhilarated‚Ä¶ Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G‚Äôs into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I‚Äôm doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride!

I‚Äôm so confused and don‚Äôt know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL!

TL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme.

110,$RKT: A Bull thesis on Short/Long-term value üöÄ,398,m9jwid,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9jwid/rkt_a_bull_thesis_on_shortlongterm_value/,165,"Hello Apes,

I am laying out the case on why $RKT - Rocket Mortgage - deserves a deeper look, and the value it has.  We have all seen the amazing DD's floating around, talking about how amazing the company is. Now let's talk about some of the catalyst that will propel Rocket to a higher valuation and amazing company. (Spoiler: No short squeeze discussion here, there are other DD's floating around for that).

&#x200B;

Several risk factors and plays affecting RKT price NOW:

* General market was in a downward trend - FED meeting
* Rates got spooked and ticked up
* Raw Material Shortage
* Lack of housing supply in prior months

Now lets look at some of the catalysts that will work in RKT's favor in the coming months:

* **Spring Housing Boom**. It is known that spring and pre-summer are the most active in real-estate, and this year is no different. We should expect an uptick in movement/sales/refi/building.
* **Biden Administration $15k first time home buyer tax credit & DACA eligibility**. This administration is kicking housing into full gear the next couple of months by offering MAJOR incentives for first time homebuyers. They are also making the 700k DACA recipients elidable for federally insured mortgages (guess where younger folks shop for stuff? Online)
* **Housing data comes out this week**. The outlook looks positive so far (I will go over this thesis in a bit) with the release of housing data, we will get a peer into the real estate market and trend. Overall, the market is still very hot, with huge demand spikes. This will only carry over into the spring housing market boom, and will incentivize more owners to capitalize on this selling opportunity and for builders to kick things into high gear. Overall the trends look good, and in favor of RKT.
* **The new inventory spike**. With homes selling quick, and bidding wars happening, supply will soon catch up to this demand and we should see an up-tick in home sales. Last month, severe winter storms temporarily disrupted some of the supple of homes nationally. As we move into March, we should see more movement.
* **Interest rate uncertainty**. This is a double edge sword. If we think of the inverse, with homeowners knowing that rate increases are imminent, it will incentivize more refi's before. On the flip, what happens when rates go up? RKT adjusts their financials as well. There are many articles analyzing the affect of higher rates, and overall, it seems to have little impact on the short term demands in the coming months.

&#x200B;

Now let's try and break apart the data we have access too, to try and predict how the housing data will look next week. Let's start with the MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTITAL CONSTUCTION, FEBURARY 2021:

&#x200B;

What we can gather from this, is Feb had a down-trend in Permits/Starts/Completions. Let's dig deeper into some of the numbers from the report. When we do, we can see that the New Privately-Owner Housing Units Authorized (Basically new builds coming up), was higher this last month by +28.9% YoY and +3.9% MoM. Ape speak? More supply is on the way!

&#x200B;

The report goes into more detail, I encourage everyone to take a deeper look. *The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.* The outlook on supply catching up to demand is in the numbers, we should see more sales happening over the next couple of months, and see a positive upward trend.

Also a good report to look into is the [Weekly Economic and Housing Market update.](https://www.realtor.com/research/video-weekly-economic-and-housing-market-update-mar-19-2021/) They talk about most of the points referenced here, but one snippet stood out:

>""Despite higher rates, our latest Weekly Housing Trends View shows that prices are rising and homes are still selling faster. More supply is needed, and is expected as we approach spring.""

As a final thought, the special dividend payment is going out this week. There is a chance of re-investments back into the stock, and valuations going up. I like the stock. I am holding this for the value.

113,What Do Bonds and Yields Mean?,661,m9iu6u,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9iu6u/what_do_bonds_and_yields_mean/,173,"I have noticed that a lot of here can't read so of course I decided to write up about Bonds. Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.

A bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.

A bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.

So reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.

Imagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.

PV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523

so if you wait a year you get more money for your car.

&#x200B;

In the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?  Let's do the same PV(present value) calculation only considering inflation:

PV + PV\*Inflation = $10000 (FV) so PV = 9803.

&#x200B;

so now considering both rates ( interest rate + inflation):

PV +PV\*interest + PV\*inflation = FV -> PV = FV / (1+ inflation+interest).

So going back to the car example and including inflation:

&#x200B;

PV = 10000 / (1 + .05+ .02) = $9345.

So, with inflation,  now the 9500 offer sounds better than 10000 next year.  The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.

&#x200B;

This is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.

&#x200B;

A similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.

So in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial.",1616311242.0

115,DD and Analysis on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.,62,m9i5q6,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9i5q6/dd_and_analysis_on_poshmark_posh_why_i_think_it/,50,"Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry. (As it expands to Australia, it is trying to enter the pets market and distribute pet supplies and accessories like Chewy)

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company‚Äôs sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. Sellers are starting to prefer the site as they do not have to deal with estimating shipping price. There is only USPS priority. This allows the item to reach the buyer much faster and saves the time of the seller. Items over $500 are sent to Poshmark to ship to the buyer. This is to verify authenticity. This reduces/eliminates any scams that sellers or buyers have to go through for fake item claims. Trust is essential. Convenience is key. 

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued. I like the stock.

116,GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD,821,m9i1at,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9i1at/gme_possible_tesla_like_short_squeeze_dd/,211,"In the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. 
&#x200b;  
#GME Graph and Shorts  
First, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  
&#x200b;  
Now, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#TSLA Graph  
Now, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     
&#x200b;  
Towards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  
&#x200b;  
Tesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#Is This Similar?
Based on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   
&#x200b;  
It is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  
&#x200b;  
#Unknowns
Now, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   
&#x200b;  
I would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  
&#x200b;  
If you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    
&#x200b;     
From this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      
&#x200b;  
That's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;

This is where it gets wack, because the calls are all anticipating a moon, but do not have anywhere close the open interest of the puts despite having very similar dollar values if ITM. The 800C far outstrips any others with a whopping 15,581 OI ($1.24 BILLION WITH A B worth of shares if ITM), the next highest being the 400C at 4,582 OI ($183m if ITM), and all the others (100,200,300,500, etc.) have roughly 4k OI or less.

Is this the day of reckoning??? If hedges were betting Ch. 11 filed by April 16 that represents 353.6 million dollars worth of shares now ITM, no telling how much was paid in premium to acquire those. The value of the top 2 call strikes (If GME were 800+) represents a quadruple return over the 353m if GME were at zero.

Whats the alternative? Based on this, it seems to me like they are going to ride this squeeze and cash in the options and make a profit 100x what any retailer will -*from their own mistake*\- and the manipulation over the last few months is what enabled it. My gut tells me that most retailers dont have the cash to mess with options in these quantities due to IV spiking premiums.

&#x200B;

What do you think is more likely now - the puts go out of the money and the calls print, hedge funds make fat $$$ off recent their recent big bet to acquire tons of high strike calls... OR Hedges original bet of GME hitting zero was actually correct and the puts print? This does of course mean that GME must hit $800/share or higher for the options to be cashed in...

121,Selling Puts: How to Profit Off Stupidly High Premiums with Put Call Parity,66,m9fw78,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9fw78/selling_puts_how_to_profit_off_stupidly_high/,84,"So everyone is trying to teach you about how the market makers are scared shitless of selling your dumbass GME calls, so they try to [deter you with stupidly high prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/) to protect themselves against a squeeze.

Some people on this sub suggest buying the stock outright. Well let me learn you some additional market mechanics.

Say you own 100 shares of $GME at $100 and you can sell a $110 call covered call for $10.

Given that price, what's the cheapest a $100 put could be to buy? Well, it better be $10 or greater because otherwise there would be an arbitrage!

Say the put cost only $9, then you could pay for the put with the $10 call, and guarantee yourself $1 per share.

So what does this mean? As call option prices are driven up by MMs, put option prices must rise similarly, and this introduces another opportunity to influence the price of the stock ***by selling puts and collecting a fat premium.***

Say you sell a put. What does the MM need to do to hedge their risk? **They need to buy stock because they are now long a put to offset the negative delta in the put.** What happens as the price moves upwards? MMs will sell that stock at a slow rate since gamma will drop off slowly. What happens if the price moves downwards? MMs will need to buy the stock an accelerating pace since gamma will increase rapidly on the put.

**This strategy will essentially put a floor on the price on the price of GME and you get to collect the premiums being induced by the MMs on the call side.**

It's also a way to lock in a buy at a lower if getting assigned on an option is your thing.

Downsides: you're short convexity on this trade, so don't expect your account to double or triple. Then again, the MMs are trying to prevent run up, so convexity is unreasonably expensive to begin with. Additionally, it's very capital intensive (unless you hedge with long puts instead of cash security).

Aside: Put call parity is actually a far more complicated mechanic with American options due to early exercise, but the point still stands that puts must increase in price along with calls if MMs try to discourage gamma squeezing.

Important Edit: Take a look at puts prices sub $100. Even a $50 put out a few months has stupidly high premiums to eat up.",1616302199.0

123,Enough with the techno mumbo jumbo A Fundamentalist Analysis of UWMC - Why I'm doubling Down,603,m9frpz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/,221,"Right, I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of doom and gloom regarding UWMC and a lot of techno analysis mumbo jumbo regarding technical analysis. Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis‚Ä¶ I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.

I am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like ‚ÄúIt might go down below 7.5,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould it head to six or five?‚Äù Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company‚Äôs market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was‚Ä¶ You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed‚Äôs reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.

A value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.

The 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).

UWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management‚Äôs estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management‚Äôs estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.

Employees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.

Management is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.

Yes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket‚Äôs massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.

At .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion‚Ä¶ This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.

But, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed‚Äôs resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM‚Äôs dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.

Now, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar‚Äôs quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I‚Äôll put supply and demand in banana speak‚Ä¶ Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana‚Äôs. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply‚Ä¶ Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!

To account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.

I will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.

So, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:

¬∑ Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.

¬∑ Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.

¬∑ Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO of UWMC.

¬∑ The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.

¬∑ HUD‚Äôs confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino‚Äôs and African American‚Äôs) lag far behind white American‚Äôs in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the ‚Äúinventory is much less‚Äù than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that ‚ÄúCredit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.‚Äù She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of ‚Äúrestructuring,‚Äù ‚Äúaccess to credit,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdown payment‚Äù as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.

¬∑ Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.

¬∑ I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.

¬∑ Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.

So, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn‚Äôt buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.

At the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC‚Äôs and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.

If a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.

This has honestly been such a long write up I‚Äôm not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.

I do expect, despite this report I‚Äôve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I‚Äôm okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I‚Äôll also tune in to Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO when it happens.

Thanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I‚Äôll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

&#x200B;

Okay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.

This time with pretty shapes!",2401,m9fq7w,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9fq7w/gme_potential_pattern_descending_triangle_to_cup/,465,"Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  üåàüêª  thesis included.

First, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441

Second, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ¬Ω. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Maybe one day?**

Okay now let‚Äôs look at just the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea

So we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.

Looking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.

Knowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.

The only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.

Evidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.

Potential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during ‚ÄúU‚Äù formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19. I have not analyzed it much yet, but it was pointed out to me by another redditor.

Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN‚ÄôT resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.

I present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger‚Äîbonds‚Äîpresents a significant downside risk.

\--

**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**

Last week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.

**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**

I can hear you retards whining about it now. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?‚Äù Yes, these are your grandparents‚Äô bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.

**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**

Back in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It‚Äôs no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.

Current P/E rates on the S&P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.

**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**

Many crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you‚Äôre saying, JPOW announced the FED won‚Äôt let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don‚Äôt think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.

Now, I‚Äôm not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There‚Äôs just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I‚Äôm going here.

**My play:**

As I‚Äôve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I‚Äôm loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I‚Äôll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.

She's going to give me a proper bollocking if this goes tits up.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugzs426t58o61.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e75f1b777dcb0e559e525301b0200ddd7a76983b

**BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO:**

They sell tobacco. They sell cigs (Newport, Camel). They sell vapes (Vuse, Glo, Velo) . They sell snuff (Grizz). The business model is extremely simple and has been a cash cow in the traditional tobacco market. Still beaten down as investors shift away from cancer in a stick and move to 50x price / sales companies. As investors start to worry about inflation and shifting to value, you're looking at value stock #1.

&#x200B;

**FUNDAMENTALS:**

Not going to spend a ton of time here as everyone knows tobacco stocks are cheap and i know all you lads don't really care about them. (also these are multiples from Friday 3/12).

EV / FWD EBITDA: 8.4

Price / Forward Cash Flow: 6.8

Price / Book: 1.0

Dividend Yield: 8.0%

$BTI is legitimately is 10 - 20x cheaper than all these tech darlings which is understandable, but maintaining this business model is simple. CAPEX is minimal and they maintain complete pricing power. Okay, well all this is obvious, so why should $BTI move up? Enter Altria (**$MO**).

**THESIS:**

* **My main thesis is that the move up in tobacco has already started.** $MO is showing strength for the first time in years. Go search for $MO on twitter and you'll find a bunch of **stick-men (technical analysis)** analysis like this:

https://preview.redd.it/8rmw9ttxd8o61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50d47e6c81b34313f26742a97777d914d2721e0

I have a piece of the $MO run-up  (not to brag), but am shifting those tendies to the better value, $BTI. I still like $MO a lot and think that the confluence of stick-men, your divvy crew, and overall lack of ""cheap"" stocks are contributing to the run up of tobacco. Now that the runway is clear, other tobacco stocks should follow ($IMBBY,  $PM are comparable if you're looking for other industry plays).

(Side note: the $MO play is straight out of the Michael Burry playbook, and may his soul rest easy after selling both $GME And $MO early. I bet his soul is resting easier after his $C calls are most likely waaaay in the money. if you are a frequent visitor, Michael, please feel free in joining me in $BTI so that you may relieve the pain of selling $MO too early).

Back to your regular programming. When you stack the performance of $MO vs. $BTI when the pandemic started, you get:

https://preview.redd.it/ab0o4l8e78o61.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1041280bb39f87b988c05ec5a91a6359e1b144e

$BTI clearly lagging after trading in tandem for a few months. This divergence has dramatically increased over the past month. Now you may say that $MO deserves to trade higher and that it must be related to performance, right? Nawww, **$BTI has outperformed $MO on a per share fundamental basis the past few years, yet still trades cheaper.** The pure strength of their combustable market is incredible. 

https://preview.redd.it/bv9m37e0e8o61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dc47910d38d8c6d9ecdf827adbb8534730038a

Seems like these should could trade closer in price, no? I have a theory or two in the risk/other section, so go check that out. Anyway, I think **\*both\*** trade higher and lift each other. Tying this all together: **My thesis is that I'm expecting $BTI to follow the $MO move and break out of its choppy zone. You'll then start to see the divvy crew and stickmen start to post about how they're adding for income or that they ""trade the chart and not the stock"".** I'll feel rekt about this if $MO reverses, so if you've gotten to this point and hate the idea, the opposite side of this whole thesis is to buy puts on a $MO reversal.

&#x200B;

**OTHER TAILWINDS:**

* **Fears of inflation?** **(Skip this bullet if you don't like economics)** You're looking at one of the most demand inelastic products on the market. People have bought tobacco and will continue to buy tobacco for years to come. There is no better place to look at this moat than with Australia (where a pack of cigs is 5x more expensive compared to the U.S.). In the past 10 years tobacco prices have doubled, yet demand has decreased by 20-ish percent. They have complete pricing power, or an economists wet dream. I'm not here to FUD you to death about how inflation is going to wreck the economy, but price increases are already here. Go look at any relevant commodity/house price/vapor ware chart and you'll see inflation baked in. $BTI has complete pricing power.

* **Growth exists for vapes**, and seem a bit undervalued after the JUUL disaster a few year ago. BTI is looking to triple their vape segment to $5B by 2025. If this was a pure tech company you could throw on a 50B market cap by that volume/percent growth alone (i know this is not comparable, but I will still keep harping on it)

&#x200B;

* **Ride the cannabis wave.** $BTI recently bought 20% of Canadian cannabis/CBD company Organigram $OGI. Would have loved to see this in 2018/2019 during the true downturn in weeeed, but these acquisitions are positive imo. A low key benefit to acquisitions in the space is that they can strike out a few times without crippling the business. Must be nice to have billions of dollars of free cash flow with small relative CAPEX [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products)
* **They are literally making a covid/flu vaccine and the irony here is next level.** You can't think of a better way to ~~create more nicotine addicted customers than injecting it straight into their veins~~ change the narrative about tobacco as an ESG plant. I guess there is a real precedent here as they've successfully used this tech for ebola. Anyway, not sure how this plays out in the long-term, but it seems like a net plus. Currently in phase I trials, I imagine successful results headline could give the price a bump. No idea when they'll announce results, but phase I trials started in December. [https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK\_\_9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP)

&#x200B;

**THE TRADE:**

* **Calls are cheap.** Like 20% IV cheap. $MO moved 20% over the past one to two-ish months and a similar move in $BTI could result in massive gainz, depending on the strike/date. The price on these bad boys are simply too cheap. I currently have been easing into calls with dates and strikes: **4/16 40, 6/18 40 and 45.**

&#x200B;

**RISKS/OTHER:**

I will tell you though, that even though i may lie on the spectrum, I'm not blind. So that you don't obliterate me into being completely biased, I have a few reasons why **$MO** has outperformed and other general comments:

* Respective Index performance: The **U.S. indices have massively outperforming the U.K market** and their stock prices are moving more in line with the index.
* **$MO has investments in beer/liquor from Anheuser Busch.** Some armchair analysts think they should sell that position as they are eligible to sell later this year. 
* **Both have shitty balance sheets** packed with oodles of goodwill from all their acquisitions over the years. $BTI has a worse debt load (Reynolds acquisition) compared to $MO so their capital allocation is less flexible (also why they earn more?). This has allowed $MO to start investing in share buybacks.
* **You're buying cancer in a stick**. I'm completely aware that large institutions and many individuals won't even look at tobacco as it's the polar opposite to any ESG play. **My mega brain** tells me that this is contradictory to many investing in any ESG plays that actually guzzle oil to operate, literally any fast food/sugar company, or most tech stocks that are melting/stealing (privacy crew, wya?) our brains. **My galaxy brain** tells me that investing in humans is the most non-ESG idea possible, so let's countertrade humans by investing in products that kill humans (was that too dark? definitely went a little dark there).
* There is **beef (lawsuits) between $BTI, $PM and $MO**. $BTI is currently suing the two for patent infringement on some of their vapes. I'm not even going to pretend like this is good or bad news for the company given the length of these timelines and unpredictability of outcomes. There is an $HCMC suit that also files against $PM, but any predicted outcome feels like pure speculation. Someone smarter than me can tell you why this case is positive/negative
* **EX-DIV is next week** at $0.75 per share. The price will trade down post recording. This is always a chicken or the egg argument, so I won't bias you in either direction. Bulls will tell you that the stock price will trade up before as investors buy in before to get the dividend, while bears will tell you owners will dump after the dividend is recorded. No opinion here, but something to be aware of.

&#x200B;

**Summary, TL;DR:**

**You're buying a company that offers a highly addictive product with complete pricing power and free cash flow to the moon. The industry outperforms in inflationary or recessionary environments. Investments in alternative products (vapes, CBD, vaccines) are all niceties and should help the business grow, while the cash cow of tobacco remains king.**

**Their main competitor, $MO  (sitting on a 52-week high) has cleared the runway for $BTI to make a similar move as the stick-men and income investors look for yield in an increasingly expensive market. The implied volatility on these calls are cheap (IV at 20).**

**BS pRiCe TaRgEtS: 1 $MO ($50.55) = 1 $BTI (Currently, $39.27). I'll let the stickmen tell you where it can actually pop to, but I believe these are fundamentally the same company on a per share basis.**

**Positions:**

Higher Risk: **4/16 40C, 6/18 45C**

Lower Risk: **6/18 40C**

Read more inside.",57,m9drpf,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9drpf/the_amc_stock_vote_will_be_a_resounding_yes_on/,165,"So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.

The majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Of course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.

Welcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.

Here comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.

The stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.

This is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.

Edit:

Everyone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.

AMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.

Thanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.  


Edit 2 :  


So lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well. The longer you wait to get into the pool, the more it costs you.  


This is why they issue more shares and eventually why they drain the pool when they are satisfied with what is available.",1616295877.0

**1.** The Endurance will be the first Pickup EV in the WORLD, with 57 beta models set to come out this month


**2.** Targeted for sale to fleet customers (This is unique compared to other EV offerings)


**3.** Marketing agreement with [Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/), one of the largest privately-owned dealership groups in the United States, established in the 1920s (Henry Ford turns in his grave as I type this)


**4.** Lordstown is the only EV company (aside from Tesla) with a huge state of the art production facility (6.2 million square feet)


**5.** Capabilities to produce an Endurance model every 6 minutes by 2022


**6.** Partnership with Camping World and Good Sam, the largest seller of Recreational Vehicles in the World with over 220 locations nationwide.  Also, see [Marcus Lemonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Lemonis)


**7.** Lordstown is currently working on their second vehicle, an Electric Van set to release in 2022 - The earnings call mentions ""Electric World"" set to debut this year.

**10.** On track to begin production in September 2021


**11.** Will use LG chem batteries (Same batteries in Tesla's Model 3 and Y)


**12.** Previous mentions of a battery pack in development for travel trailers that will eliminate the need for standalone generators - ([GREAT reference article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup))

You would be blind to not see real potential here, with a target to sell to fleet customers, Lordstown Motors will have many future catalysts, and the best part is that it's an American company.

Now, Imagine how foolish you would feel to ignore the current dip.

The stock price was **$13.30** at market close on 3/19/21 and was just above **$30** on 2/11/21

**My Assessment/Prediction:**

This stock will launch directly to the moon and settle. - The purpose of the current baseless short attack is to push the stock price down so large investment firms can get in while it's low (maximum gains). Then they too will go to the moon with us.

# #RIDEORDIE

**TLDR:** RIDE is going to the moon and bears are actually bulls playing a different angle on their investment.

**Info -** 


Hims & Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims & Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims & Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:


* Skin Care
* Hair Loss and Care
* Sex products (ED, PE, Contraception)
* Covid Tests 
* Supplements
* Primary Care
* Mental Care


**Financials -** 


* Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
* Gross Margin of  77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
* 2.6B Market Cap
* Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
* Q4 EPS  of -.07 (Beat by .09)
* Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
* 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
* Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
* $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
* Over 3 Million consultations 
* 91% Recurring Revenue


Simply put, Hims & Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, with the main problems being in the Cash Flow and Earnings per Share. However, both are improving significantly over time.

**Growth -**


Hims & Hers has many avenues to expand in, in every single part of their company. Because of how 91% of revenue is recurring, Hims & Hers is free to take many risks in expanding, as revenue will not be negatively affected as long as the subscription models are sustained.

Hims & Hers' Revenue numbers are also almost only Sexual Health and Hair/Skin Care for now, as their recent additions of Primary and Mental Care have not gotten adoption yet. In Q2 of 2020 92% of Revenue was from Skin and Hair Care, as mainly recurring revenue. Once adoption of Hims & Hers Primary and Mental Care picks up, I can see the company's revenue increasing greatly, and the ecosystem created through Hims & Hers' other products will strengthen this growth.

The structure of Hims & Hers also a large reason Hims & Hers has grown so much in only two years, and why the company can continue to grow. Almost every single part of the Hims & Hers experience is proprietary and created in-house, as there were no outside options at the time. However, as these structure growths have already been completed, this means that these next few years are when they will be refined, increasing gross margins, cutting out unnecessary expenses, and allowing the company to escape the bloat of the American Healthcare system caused by individual medicine companies.

Although Healthcare is already a Four Trillion Dollar industry, I believe that Hims & Hers has an opportunity to grow the industry as well. Many people across America simply do not receive the healthcare they need, whether due to costs, waiting time, distance, or other reasons, and Hims & Hers solves all of those problems. With appointments being online anyone across America and get diagnosed and receive a prescription within minutes, without needing to live near a hospital, and at a low cost.


**Competitors + Why Hims & Hers?**


I would say that Hims & Hers has a lot of overall competitors, but not for its niche and for many different reasons.
The biggest overall competitor would be $TDOC. As they are both in the Telehealth industry, they will inevitably clash, and of the two $TDOC is much larger. However, Hims & Hers offers direct sales of a large variety of medicine and health care products, which $TDOC does not. Because of this, I believe Hims & Hers will have a larger overall ecosystem in product offered, as well as capture the niche market requiring Skin Care, Hair Loss and Care, and Sex products, which $TDOC does not focus on. I also see Hims & Hers as having a much larger favorability with younger generations, particularly millennials and under, due to a few reasons:


* Branding- $HIMS is heavier on advertising, and their company image is more ""high status"" than $TDOC
* More importance/education on Skin Care, Sex products, and Hair Loss and Care
* Affordability - Hims & Hers has primary care consultations for $39, which is a nice, consistent price especially when compared to the American healthcare system
* Their Twitter account posts memes


Other competitors: Those random Telehealth apps nobody knows about, Amazon (more pricing power on medicine), CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid (Lol)

139,What's Wrong With This Picture? - Precious Metals DD,275,m9c17l,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9c17l/whats_wrong_with_this_picture_precious_metals_dd/,315,"So I keep hearing that Silver is ""historically undervalued"" and I wanted to do some DD to see how rare it really is, and what the price should be realistically in comparison to the other metals.

Take a look at the numbers and judge for yourselves.

The big five precious metals are:

PLATINUM

Current Price **$1205/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 350 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry. Current uses are for catalytic converters but as cars switch to EV, will be used for battery cells. Also used in jewelry.

GOLD

Current Price: **$1740/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 10 Billion or a cube 25m on each side.

Uses: TO FUCKING BALL OUT OF CONTROL

PALLADIUM

Current Price: **$2746/Ounce** (up 12% last month)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 24 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry.

RHODIUM

Current Price: **$29,000/Ounce** (WTF! up 200% YTD)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 70 million

Uses: Most commonly used as an alloy agent with other metals, Also used in jewelry, electric contacts and catalytic converters. Very hard substance. But apparently can be replaced with platinum (if you use more platinum).

SILVER

Current Price **$26.25/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 49 Billion mined but only 27 billion remain.

In 2020, 978M ounces of Silver were produced globally, and the total demand was 963M ounces. But, only 215M ounces were for investment purposes. The remaining silver was used for commercial purposes (475M and and 96M just for solar), jewelry (187M), photography (30M) and silverware (54M). Crazy to think that many people are still buying real silverware (although I hear a lot is plated).

Almost half of the silver ever mined is now in a landfill. Also, it is not yet economically feasible to scavenge the landfills for salvageable silver based on the price (things aren't that blade runnery yet.)

Uses: The best conductor of electricity, used in all electronics and EVs. Silver is also used as an antibacterial agent. Also used as currency throughout history and as a fast way to move large amounts of wealth. The US Constitution explicitly mentions gold and silver as money.

So....

Why is the price of silver so low?

It occurs in the earth's crust at a ratio of 8 to 1 compared to gold yet it's only worth enough to feed a family of four at McDonalds? People have to literally dig this stuff out of the FUCKING GROUND.

*Something doesn't add up.*

The current price ratio is 65 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold. Throughout history, the ratio has remained closer to 16 to 1 which at this gold price would imply a silver price of $112.

This sounds a little better.

Bank manipulation is well known in this space, and the paper market for silver only functions to suppress the price. If trading was conducted in a responsible manner the silver price would be much higher. Yesterday alone, 280 million ounces were bought and sold. This equates to 28% of the yearly mine production. The big banks control the majority of the metals and have unlimited ammunition to short. This happens late at night, when there is no liquidity to push down the price. But the price has recently started to resist these dumps.

But the tides are turning, someone has been removing physical silver from the COMEX vaults and it is being drained at an alarming rate. This month, 26 million ounces of physical silver has been removed, which is almost four times the normal amount. It has been hypothesized that manufacturers are starting to source their metals from the COMEX directly. Additionally, the Perth Mint has been rumored to have run out of unallocated physical silver bars.

If there is even a tiny inkling of a bank run on silver, the price will shoot higher. And if you look at how undervalued silver is, both historically and when compared to other precious metals, the trade becomes a no brainer.

This is one of the last great trades.  They can't hold the ball under water forever.

I would like to see this turn into a transfer of wealth from the blood sucking banks into the hands of us, the people. Silver will always be the people's money and this may be one of our only hopes to preserve our wealth for future generations.",1616290978.0

One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that ‚Äúthe number of recent conversations \[on Reddit\] including both GME and stimulus is low.‚Äù

As some of you know, I‚Äôve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.

I'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the ""stimmy effect"" recently.

To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:

[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)

Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:

[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)

The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:

[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)

From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.

|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|
|:-|:-|
|3/15/21|124|
|3/14/21|103|
|3/16/21|74|
|3/13/21|69|
|1/14/21|67|

To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.

[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\/ \\""stimmy ratio\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)

I don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.

I'm as close to being retarded as one can be. You're almost guaranteed to profit by betting against me and as such, neither is financial advise. The following is my observations.

Generally speaking I genuinely believe that immunity and the progress of vaccination  is oversold and that the broader market is hyped on fugazi. The facts remain:

The projected immunity of the US population (stated that 70-90% being fully vaccinated) is around Oct-Nov^(1).

The US awaits the Trial of AstraZeneca before FDA approval (I'll return to why I estimate this approval won't change much).

""Only"" 12.x% of the US is currently 2-dose vaccinated.

AAL is nearing in on the stock price around $30 prior to Covid-19 restrictions and the market fall in March 2020 - and that's even with their own projections of Q1 capacity being down 45%^(2).

The projection^(1) estimates \~50% being 2-dose vaccinated during the summer months (June-August).

&#x200B;

**Why FDA approval of AstraZeneca won't change the projections imo**

CVST is the short answer. I know fuck-shit about medice or the likes however, I do follow the vaccine status of the EU where I'm residing and the increased number of reports of Blood Clots in the brain (the ones being smooth on you) post AstraZeneca Jabs (*I'm not myself saying they are directly linked, others are indicating this though*). As of writing there has been:

* 2 Deaths in Denmark
* 1 Death in Norway
* 1 Death in Spain
* 1 Death in Austria

That *may* have been linked to the injection of AstraZeneca. The EMA had a conclusion on their hearing the 18th that stated ""The benefint (READ: Herd immunity) outweighs the risk""^(3). Norwegian researches came to the conclusion that it was linked to the Astra vaccine^(4).

And in the context of the US we'll need to look at **risk factors** for CVST, where one in adults is Obesity^(5). According to CDC above 40% was Obese through 2017-2018^(6) (too lazy to find newer numbers).

All the above nonsense is fine, what matters is **public perception**. Choose between Pfizer/Moderna or a Vaccine that in the media is portrayed as only \~60% effective^(7) and has resulted in blood clots. *I know which one I'd prefer.*

Oh yeah, Ursula von der Leyen threatens to halt export of Astra jabs until the EU has had their promised deliveries, which are delayed and pose a risk to the EU herd immunity progress. (*Tinfoil-hat on* which may be why the EMA and WHO really needs to calm the tits down of the general public surrounding the vaccine? *Tinfoil-hat off*).

&#x200B;

**So, back to AAL**

How will this affect AAL leading into the summer you ask. Less travel. Less travel than anticipated at least.

But, what about easing the travel restrictions?

Well, there may be *domestically*, idk about internal US policy but from my point of view, jamming many people together in a metal tube for hours while still not immune in the herd might be just about as dumb as buying these puts.

Internationally, I highly doubt we'll see travel unless the vaccination pasport is introduced, which projection wise only half of the US population would be able to supply at that time. Iceland already did this.

We're seeing more and more evidence for a third wave in Europe with Paris going in lockdown^(8).

Oh, right, the negative impact 2020 had and Covid overall on flying, cruises and the likes is also underplayed imo. I think we'll see some time go by before we're back to anything remotely close to pre-covid, if we ever get there..

Another observation is that the reported passengers while increasing in to double and nearly tripple from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 respectively, there isn't much upside to be seen in the Qx reportings that yield -2.07B, -2.4B and -2.18B.

&#x200B;

**What am I looking at buying**

PUTS. Puts around a strike price of $24 since I'm too scared to go hardcore short via CFDs (which we Europoors can). I also need to keep up my trackrecord of shorting via Puts which is 100% loss üòé

I'll be attempting to gather Put options with strike $24, Expiry  20th of August and hopefully a premium of 2.0-3.0 which seems about adequate for my pessimistic perception of the aviation sector going into Q2-Q3 2021.

Im poor af so may only be able to get 2 contracts at this premium. We'll see. I'll update when (if i get the premium i want) the options.

As always, *not financial advise.*

Bought 2 puts since I'm a poor fuck that can't afford more. The decline today obliterated the premium target I had hoped. I had actually anticipated a further increase nearing $30 target but that wasn't the case today and I'm too impatient to wait.

149,UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now? Why you shouldn‚Äôt panic sell. A value play and long term hold: Part 2,227,m93mec,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m93mec/uwmc_not_added_to_russel_indiceswhat_now_why_you/,165,"So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I‚Äôm going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. 

I previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that‚Äôs not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can‚Äôt complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. 

But the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. 

First of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn‚Äôt change too much. 

This is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:


- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:

4 buys, 1 hold.

Low: 10.50
Average: 11.70
High: 13.50

This represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. 

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings

- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn‚Äôt put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.

- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he‚Äôs that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. 

- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. 

- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. 

- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I‚Äôm bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)

- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. 

- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a ‚Äúmoat.‚Äù That‚Äôs how you grow a company. 

Some bear points:

- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don‚Äôt think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. 

- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I‚Äôd say that if you‚Äôre in the industry, you know that the housing market isn‚Äôt cooling off any time soon. However, I won‚Äôt claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.

- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. 

- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I‚Äôd say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. 

- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. 


Let me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.

I am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. 

This post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47.",1616261545.0

Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.

It pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions. Yes this is a casino, but at least act like you're trying to win damnit.

153,UWMC is not on the final Russell Index inclusion list,331,m911ba,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m911ba/uwmc_is_not_on_the_final_russell_index_inclusion/,264,"We all got played my friends. UWMC CEO, Mat Ishibia is too stubborn. I read somewhere he holds 90% of the company. No wonder index did not want to get involved. If you want to hold 90% of the company you should have left it private. Why even go public?

Index or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company. He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public. There are many great companies like IKEA and Lego that are private because the families that own them did not want to sell their shares.

Brace yourself for bagholding. If you ask me, you should be selling options on this confusing stock. Don't get fooled into buying options. This one is not a stock for the beginners. You need to play intelligently. You need to play the strategies that pay you, not the other way around.

Positions: 1.4K ITUB 9/17 $6 C CB 0.23

**The Pledge**

Itau is the largest banking institution in Brazil, has a rigorous history of merger and aquisition strategy to increase market share, \~8% revenue decline in 2020 compared to \~20% for the industry big dogs (JPM, Citi), increasing tech investment and my Brazilian friend said they were the best out of Itau, Bradesco and Santander.

The bull market in value stocks since November was prematurely aborted in Brazil for obvious, public reasons <political statements deleted>. The stock is still \~50% off Jan 2020 highs, IMO putting it solidly in undervalued territory.

**The Turn**

<political statements deleted>, one analysis is that things might not be as bad as they seem in the Florida of South America (shoutout to @[CallsOnAlcoholism](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallsOnAlcoholism/)) and even if they are, they have until September to figure it out. Other bullish signals:

\- The Brazilian Central Bank made use of a recently passed autonomy law (limiting exec/legislative interference) by increasing its benchmark interest rate to 2.75% \[larger than expected 75 bp increase compared to 50 bp expected\] and they signalled a repeat at their next meeting in May. Rising interest rates are generally good for bank stocks as they increase revenue/margins. Whether they are similarly good for emerging economy bank stocks, I guess I will find out.

\- The three analysts I could find that follow this stock returned an average price target of %7.50 (just confirmation bias, analysts are mostly tea-leaf readers).

\- Minimal short interest 25M shares (0.6% of float).

**The Prestige**

Brazil has a funny trend of shitting the bed when you expect it to pay off, and paying off when you expect it to shit the bed. My analysis is that the negative catalysts have been priced in, blood is in the streets, and the probability of positive catalysts appearing before September is greater than 0.5. Shares are likely a better play than options, substantial return potential and lower risk.

Obviously the best play is to avoid entirely (see previous 100% loss), Brazil is a crazy place.

So I will start with I saw someone's DD the past two weeks and I started diving in and I like where ASO is at.  I am going to keep this short and sweet.  Last quarters earnings proj at .36, actual was .91.  This was early December.  Christmas and two damn  stimmys later and this quarter is March 30th for earnings release with the Trailing 12 looking very nice (Up 10% rev).  ""But stimmys go to GME like good ape should"" ... and I agree.  But the customers they cater to are not apes my fellow apes.  They are of the reddest of necks.  And rednecks don't need bananas, they need guns and ammo! (Cue 80's Rock mix)

Here is their company description.

The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is based in Katy, Texas.

&#x200B;

I even saw one that described the company as ""catering to local flavor"" by selling crawfish boilers....

TL;DR   Potential to Squeeze?  Who the fuck knows.  Potential to pop off naturally?  Fucking Maybe.  All I know is rednecks arent buying GME and they have too many damn kids so their Stimmys are huge.  What do you do when your trailer is paid off?  Buy more guns and Ammo.  $ASO Q4 looks amazing to me.

4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. 

That‚Äôs before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there‚Äôs no such thing as BAD press. 
(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) 

I ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you‚Äôre sooooooooo fucked!!!!!

If you use normal website sale conversations it‚Äôs usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you‚Äôre looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven‚Äôt figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let‚Äôs say that visitor rate increases 3x that‚Äôs 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can‚Äôt you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN‚ÄôT even started yet and you‚Äôre shorting has given it a share price of $200.

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

These are just a few. There are more.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. üöÄ

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 


We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

182,UWMC Russell Inclusion,108,m8vckk,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8vckk/uwmc_russell_inclusion/,65,"--------------------

EDIT:  This is moot now since it didn't get included, but u/thefinnishsisu reached out to me and pointed out that Russell indexes are actually float-adjusted market cap weighted, meaning that for the purposes of the index, they will be treated as a $100M market cap company if they ever get included.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/m9kp1n/some_more_dd_about_the_russell_inclusion_since/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

---------------------

Ok so I have a decent position in UWMC, picture in another post.  I was curious to try to predict exactly what Russell 1000 and 3000 inclusion would do.

For those who don't know, these are both market-cap weighted funds.  The Russell 3000 is the 3000 biggest companies in the US, which makes them about 98% of the US stock market by market cap.  The Russell 1000 is the biggest 1000 of the Russell 3000, which makes them about 90% of the stock market.

Since the whole US stock market is a bit above $50T, that makes the Russell 3000 about $50T and the Russell 1000 about $45T.  They are honestly not that different, the Russell 3000 just contains an extra 2000 companies which barely move the needle, because it's market-cap weighted (not equal-weight)

Ok so once I figured that out, my next question was, exactly how many funds track these indexes?  The answer was disappointing.  There are two main ETFs for each (iShares and Vanguard).   And then there are a bunch of little mutual funds.  I couldn't get a complete list but I doubt that all of this combined adds up to much more than $50B in assets (comparitively, SPY is just one ETF and it has $330B in net assets, and that doesn't count all the mutual funds that track the S&P 500)

So as a really rough estimate, 0.11% of a Russell 1000 company's market cap will be in these funds.  (maybe a little more, like 0.12% or 0.13%)

The one thing that UWMC had going for it is that it's market cap is large and the float is small -- only 6% of the market cap.  So that means that in order to buy 0.11% of the market cap, they have to buy about 1.83% of the float.  Let's round up to 2% because I didn't look at all the mutual funds.  I could not really find a good source of data here.

Conclusion:  ETFs and mutual funds need to buy about 2% of UWMC's float.  That's about 2 million shares.  Average daily volume is about 10M shares.  There might be a small boost but this is not a massive squeeze or anything.

I believe that there are a couple of catalysts that will extend the hot housing market and RKT is perfectly positioned to take advantage.

1. Biden's 15K first time home buyer tax credit. This will be HUGE. This can be used at the time of closing so that down payment is effective lower. In cheaper places, [\~40% more renters would be able to afford a median mortgage](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/renters-and-bidens-15000-homebuyer-tax-credit/). Guess which demographic group is the most likely first time buyer? That's right, tech-savvy millennials who will likely shop for their mortgage online. RKT is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this, and they will also have a suit of complimentary offers such as home insurance, title services, and realtors, all in the Rocket/Quicken ecosystem. 
2. [DACA recipients will be eligible for federally insured mortgages.](https://themortgagereports.com/73772/fha-accepting-daca-home-loans) There are 700,000 DACA recipients. Again these are all young people, [with an average age of 24](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/). You can bet that they will likely shop for mortgages online. They are probably less likely to walk into a bank branch to ask for a mortgage.

I couldn't find any more recent statistics, but back in 2016 already [millennials were already twice as likely to use quicken mortgage](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2017/03/07/fueled-rocket-mortgage-detroit-based-quicken-loans-achieves-record-breaking-year/). 

These catalyst, combined with the already conservative guidance, means RKT will crush expectations on their earnings for at least the next few quarters, maybe then they will earn the respect of the market.",1616223270.0

And Merck is publicly traded under $MRK. That‚Äôs right apes, Pitbull aka Mr. worldwide style. No matter the country your wife‚Äôs bf takes her she will be able to get plan b and a covid pill to set her straight before coming home. 

Looking at Moderna when they announced their covid vaccine their stock more than doubled. $MRK stands for a chance to do the same (if they actually have succeeded in developing a drug that fights covid)

Now $MRK play here may be long (depending on their approval with the FDA) however this is a safe one. More results end of this month.

Let‚Äôs look at numbers which you won‚Äôt understand or care about:

1.	Dividends (extra bananas every 3 months) = range of .61 to .65 per share (1000 shares = $650 bananas every 3 months to feed your $GME addiction)

5.	Options are affordable still ($2 range for $85 calls in Jan 2022)
6.	Earnings EPS 1.5-1.3 last (next on 4/29)

However, the truth is we don‚Äôt know when it will happen, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to try to guess.

What we can do however is predict the next bearish or bullish cycles within GME, and we can position ourselves accordingly to trade well. For example, holders can have an idea of how long they need to hold so you don‚Äôt get spooked into selling too early, and buyers can enter in at educated price points.

GME is currently in the very last days of its bullish MACD sentiment. In the chart below we can see that on 2/25 MACD flipped to positive, triggering the start of a bull run. As of 3/19 the MACD histogram bar is very low and with W%R and +DI trending down it looks like on Monday MACD will flip to negative, confirming a bear run.

[2\/25 - 3\/19](https://preview.redd.it/jzkjlx5hb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5835a25e613d379340c2f52da7b1004b1de4deec)

Now, the question is how long will bearish sentiment last for? For reference lets look at the last two times the MACD histogram was negative:

&#x200B;

[1\/27-2\/26](https://preview.redd.it/n35a3qlkb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e93ef2c67df5f7598139d211144db90b76e987)

In this example (2/4-2/24), we can see that bearish sentiment lasted about 14 trading days. We should note however, that this is right after huge volume and sudden spike in price.

Now another example:

&#x200B;

[12\/8-1\/13](https://preview.redd.it/0x6qf54ob2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10e245f52cb96382e7eeca802024346475218c7)

Looking back from 12/10-1/12 we can see that GME was following a 6 to 8 day bearish to bullish trend. Important to note is that these trends did not spike the price too much and volume was relatively low.

Now looking ahead to 3/22 and onward, I can safely predict that there should be a bearish trend. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean prices will dramatically plummet but institutions know that trying to raise prices against negative MACD momentum isn‚Äôt favorable. Also, I can also say that if a bearish trend starts, it should last something like 6-14 days. Our most recent bullish trend had decent volume and there was also a pretty dramatic price change, and so I think the real number will in the middle of those two extremes.

Now I know that is a very large window of time, but it really does depend on what happens during the next two weeks to determine if the MACD histogram will overturn. Events like the earnings report on 3/23, and if RC announces a CEO position could help overturn sentiment.

I'm sorry if this doesn't feed your confirmation bias or if you think im trying to spread FUD. I just wanted to share so we can make educated trades and stay in the game longer so we can get this thing to squeeze!

Gamers are some of the most strong-willed and tenacious people on the planet. We regularly spend hours in highly toxic and competitive arenas... **AND WE FUCKING LOVE IT!** 

Now, we stand before the real life- **""Level: 100 of 100 Gatekeepers,""** that have been hacking the game for centuries, with almost complete amnesty from the Moderation and Dev teams. 

In these online arenas, we not only face our opposition head-on, but communicate with them on a personal level. Any cheaters are usually caught, banned, and punished. Effectively, making these online lobbies, with virtually no real-life stake, more governed and moderated than **the fucking stock market...** and that speaks volumes! 

The SEC's intervention into this broken, cheated, and rigged game is overwhelmingly pathetic. 

When you consider the real-life stake that is on-the-line in the stock market, with it being people's livelihood & futures at potential risk, where is the balance here? -You're telling me, that a virtual world with no real-life stake, is just, much more fair than the latter? That is so incredibly ass-hat backwards. 

That's why as community, we need to voice our interests, ideas, and opinions of GameStop's future- Re-imagining the possibilities and laying-out a vision for its potential future. 

Personally, I see the largest gaming organization of all time, with a brick and mortar foundation that's paved and primed for endless possibilities. Storefronts that offer everything in consoles, to a flourishing mecca for PC gamers, \[along the likes of micro-center,\] *(which btw has limited locations w/ little infrastructure for expansion.)* Each store having gaming lounges, where local gamers can team-up, practice, and compete. An annual eSports Championship that covers every competitive title, with total coverage and a production value of the Superbowl/Olympics... Lastly, a thriving eCommerce platform with the same vitality as of everything aforementioned. 

It seems the future of GameStop still remains a bit hazy, we all have different ideas of what it could be, and no real conceptualizations for what it will become. If we started sculpting a collective vision of what we see for GameStop, the more conviction every ape will have. Drastically reducing the amount of paper-handed bitches- **Apes together strong!**

Additionally, the Shorts doubled down and bought thousands of PUTs.  the magic number was 200.  We just put a clinic on them, the LONGs have us holding that support.  We're not selling and the Longs know that.  So, lets look at next week...  once these AMC peeps realize we've been the endgame all along they'll come back.  They chased 15 bucks and got burned.

206,Why closing at $14 and $200 DOES NOT MATTER- let‚Äôs do this again,2009,m8rx62,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8rx62/why_closing_at_14_and_200_does_not_matter_lets_do/,325,"**why closing at $14 and $200  DOES NOT MATTER** Facts not FUD

I see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) 

**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That‚Äôs NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner

This is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you‚Äôre watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. 

On to the options component of our class - 

Obviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I‚Äôm going to try a practical approach.

Use the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went ‚Äúoh well looks like I‚Äôm short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.‚Äù

OF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúgamma squeeze.‚Äù

As people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!

There‚Äôs all sorts of slightly technical reasons there‚Äôs small overhangs at 4:00 but it‚Äôs mostly done. 

Second practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear ‚Äúif the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren‚Äôt the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don‚Äôt you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?

Options markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what‚Äôs happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There‚Äôs slightly more to it (you can look up ‚Äúpin risk‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax pain‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôm trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.",1616219076.0

212,SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME,332,m8r4yt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8r4yt/setting_the_record_straight_on_borrow/,119,"There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y‚Äôall but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here‚Äôs the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)‚Äôs ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let‚Äôs look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone‚Äôs stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren‚Äôt showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or ‚ÄúGC‚Äù (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.",1616216898.0

Dear Apes,
What you just witnessed with AMC at the last 2 minutes of the market close, was horrible. We get back at them by selling our shares at extreme prices for both GME and AMC, so the Hf and their traders looses everything, their Manhattan penthouse, their chauffeured Bentley, their Michelin star chefs and regret their whole lives thinking a bunch of apes, turned their whole lives upside down. 
That‚Äôs the price I want for 2008, for apes holding these stocks, their mental fatigue, all the sleepless nights, their kids, family, house, medical, students at schools. This is enough.
I do insist all the day traders and investors to make money through other stocks and dump in these stocks, take help from your fellow friends, apes help each other make money by holding and making each other get their desired prices. Us divided is what they are praying on, imagine us united will make those big boys piss their pants, they are 1% cause we have our money invested in their companies. Their ability to manipulate, cheat and bend the rules to their will, I say that‚Äôs enough. We have seen enough, I am humbled, but really pissed. Today a lot of my fellow apes have options OTM and who is responsible the HF, the powerful institutions and financial market caretakers are doing nothing about it. Who is suffering us, us retail investors and traders. 
Look out for each other, all our lives we have competed with one another making money out of each other, this is the one time we can make the money off the 1% I say we take it. Win or loose is upto god, but not trying will be on us. 
It‚Äôs not the end of your life even a day can change your life, be positive, relax and trust the path you have chosen for yourselves. 
I myself own 180@14 AMC and 80@230 GME shares, keeping some money to buy more, I am trying and hoping for the best.  
Hold and buy if possible don‚Äôt loose hope not now, not when things might go our way for once in life.

216,NAPA went public. It's the perfect stock,147,m8qsqz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8qsqz/napa_went_public_its_the_perfect_stock/,100,"Winemaker Duckhorn ($NAPA) went public on 3/18/21 ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/napa-valley-winemaker-duckhorn-rises-after-300-million-ipo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/napa-valley-winemaker-duckhorn-rises-after-300-million-ipo)). Very rare for winemakers to go public.

This is the perfect stonk and I have been doing some DD over the last few years before they even thought about going public.

Their product is great üç∑üç∑üç∑. No idea about the financial details but here are the two scenarios I see:

**Scenario 1**

The stonk goes up üöÄüöÄüöÄ. You are happy and can buy expensive wine without feeling guilty üç∑üç∑üç∑. After all the wine paid for itself with the gainz. Stonk goes up more and you can buy more wine. It‚Äôs a self feeding circle.

**Scenario 2**

The stonk goes down üò≥. You are sad for a moment and drown your sorrows in some wine üç∑üç∑üç∑. The more it dropped that day, the more wine you have to drink and buy. That helps the company and the stonk will go up again üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Disclaimer for Scenario 2: Stonks usually don‚Äôt go down, so this is more a theoretical case. As of this writing NAPA has never closed at a loss üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

**The greeks**

I studied the Greeks as well. They love wine. So no showstopper there either in case you‚Äôre into options. And good wine becomes more valuable when you hold, so no danger from theta here.

**The squeeze scenario**

They squeeze grapes for about 1.4M cases of wine per year \[1\]. That is 16.8M bottles. r/wallstreetbetscurrently has 9.6M Degenerates. If everyone buys two bottles that‚Äôd be 114% of the yearly supply (aka float). That‚Äôs enough to make the price (of the wine) skyrocket as all the fancy restaurants scramble to get their demand filled (usually only about 39% go to retail investors like us \[2\]). That will then make the stock go to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Now you can diamond hand üíéüôåüíéüôå the wine and the stock and make double the money.

**TLDR**

Stonk goes red, drink more red until stonk goes green, then drink more red.

PS: This is not financial advice. Drink responsibly. Don‚Äôt drink and drive.

PPS: I own 30 stocks and a bottle of wine. Planning to buy more.

Undervalued compared to what? Traditional and pure-play companies deserves a low forward P/E and P/S because they don't have the potential to scale up, innovate, and revolutionize their industry - they are only there to make constant small profit for shareholders. This is why these companies will eventually have constant dividend and not reinvest back into the company expansion. Makes for good retirement investment where you want constant income. On the other hand, tech companies need to have either a new technology/product or have some way to digitally transform the industry that can quickly scale.

RKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own broker tools that's customizable, as well as investing in data analytics and AI-assisted automation. They have a 2500-strong software team in Detroit. RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app (although I've heard their app is pretty good). Just look at their acquisitions and some of their other businesses:

1. Nexsys Technologies makes a platform for mortgage lenders that automate homeowner insurance verification, and is being integrated with Lemonade
2. Lendesk, a Canadian aquisition that makes end-to-end digital mortgage solutions
3. forsalebyowner is a property listing site, kinda like zillow and redfin
4. Finally, their flagship rocket mortgage/quicken loans is the first digital mortgage experience - they are the ones who brought on the digital revolution of the mortgage industry. They are the real OGs and are continuing to innovate.

If you think Lemonade is a tech company (it is), then RKT is a tech company. Even more, it's a tech company that has succeeded in its own field and is rapidly expanding/acquiring. 

On the other hand, everyone is familiar with the feud between RKT and UWMC, and arguments for which is a better company. While I think UWMC has done well in recent year in terms of rapidly expanding in the broker channel, I don' think they are a tech company and thus shouldn't have a long term high forward valuation. Their flagship platform for brokers, Blink+, is a third party software that they pay per use (see their [S1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-016729/)). So here they save the initial investment that makes the finances look better for IPO, but will eat into their margins later.",1616209827.0

Link for the lazy [https://iborrowdesk.com/faq](https://iborrowdesk.com/faq)

At the very bottom, the FAQ says the following:

""It's also worth noting that IBorrowDesk only tracks Interactive Brokers data - it could be that other brokerages have many shares available. Professional or institutional investors have access to data sources far more sophisticated than this site - which can only track a single, albeit very large and active, brokerage.""

At first I was confused, and picked my nose with an axe. Then, I had a jimmy nerdtron brainblast, and realized this meant that IBorrowDesk does not showcase all of the available shares to borrow for shorting purposes. Investigating the amount of shares available to borrow from other brokers is key to monitoring what the hedge funds are up to. Relying solely on IBorrowDesk is incomplete data at best, and confirmation bias at worst.

I am not a financial advisor, but I want people to be aware that they're not looking at the full data.

Vistra Corp is a company. A company in Texas where it was unexpectedly cold for a little while. Actually, more specifically, Vistra Energy is an energy producer and provider, serving millions in dozens of states. This is done both via wholesale power sales or its retail segment. Even amongst other energy gorillas in the absolutely massive energy zoo, the firm is no small ape slinger; it is the largest competitive energy provider in the United States with over 39 GW of power generation in its portfolio ‚Äì a number capable of sending Marty back to the future to sleep with your wife 32x. It also rivals that of traditional utilities like Duke Energy or Southern Company.

https://preview.redd.it/fhp9400xu0o61.jpg?width=195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c495202d872f2a32627086343335bec39b260e

""So what?""

Beginning this year, EBITDA over the next three years was expected to be in excess of $9,000mm, of which the firm would have converted 60% of that to free cash flow. While some of that was set to fund growth projects (investments in renewables), the bulk of it was going to be returned to shareholders in the form of either dividends or shareholder buybacks. The firm was coming off of a multi-year deleveraging cycle and had achieved the leverage metrics necessary to qualify for investment grade credit, meaning that the heavy lifting on the balance sheet was done and it was time for the equity to benefit. The market, for various reasons, was fundamentally mispricing this opportunity. Vistra Energy traded with free cash flow yields to the equity in excess of 20%, and even traded with double digit annual free cash flow yields on the entire enterprise.

Vistra was doing well. Really well. Then came this once in a lifetime storm. Investors thought, ""no big deal. They can weather this thing."" But then the management peeps disclosed a forecast of $900 ‚Äì 1,300mm in the aftermath of the freeze. In addition, media reported wiffs of bankruptcies across these companies.  BOOM! Sell-off.

But what happened? and is Vistra really in danger? Well, lots of  things happened that my smooth brain doesn't entirely comprehend, but it turns out it was an ERCOT pricing error outside their control. They were really well prepared to deal with this if it weren't for some stupid incompetent bureaucracy.

Vistra did good before the storm. They predicted the weather event and spent money to be ready. In fact, they were more ready than your wife's BF when you're in the taxi on the way to the airport for a business trip. Before the storm, they locked up natural gas supplies. They were prepped to be supplying energy in the face of this severe catastrophe.

https://preview.redd.it/csq9qfb6v0o61.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a491d2fcb5ffbb9699dc88a454f868f4c0957a2a

The winter storm comes and the grid gets shut down. Other fake and inefficient energy production like wind and solar go offline.

Through all of this drama, Vistra Energy is supplying a large portion of the power of the grid as one of the few electricity providers that was prepared. Yet, inexplicably, the ERCOT mandated price was slow to respond to conditions. Even with half of Texas power generation offline and load demand near all-time winter highs, market prices were not where they should have been.

For perspective, stated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.

Ultimately Biff ended up with Marty's mom, Marty doesn't get to the clock tower and Vistra get's screwed.

Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.

End of the day, despite making the correct weather call, the firm ended up with a higher cost of goods mix than it anticipated (higher natural gas prices, less use of coal-fired generation) and pricing issues related to the Monday morning ERCOT issue.

Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count.

Resistance (wave i): 231.02

Major Support (wave 4): 172.50 

Minor Support (wave ii): 183.58

**Discussion**

After watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \~ 264; iii \~286; (i) between 286 and 382.

**Conclusion:** As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now. ENJOY the UPSIDE!

I liked it and the market is warming up‚Äî lots of talk about partnership and even battery customization. With the event on Thursday and intraday action slowly turning around, I‚Äôm still bullish and will hold. Particularly because my average down paid off well. 

**3/22 9 am update**

**3/22 AM UPDATE**

Fine and pleased with everything else, but seeing no real reason for the GM dump no matter what I search. 

If they don‚Äôt announce a partnership with TSLA or something in the next hour my gf is gonna fucking kill me when she wakes up...as we pack for the shelter. üò≠ 

**3/21 Weekend Update**

1) **Noticed**: a lot of activity on PTON I noticed while reviewing Friday (wrote this week on Thursday)

2) **GM**: they added two more events in the next like 8 days to their investor relations page. These and other events for the week have been thrown up on the new look spotrambo.com

3) **don‚Äôt just dive in to stuff** at open tomorrow if you‚Äôre not feeling it, could be a weird week. An hour wait rule. 

**One more 3/19 Update:**

People are asking what I mean when I say RAMBO. I created www.spotrambo.com (with the help of my new BFF üß†) which has a decent explainer and I‚Äôll be putting some more up over the weekend, and a big batch Sunday. 

**Update 3/19 mid day:**

Doing this one early because your boy is heated.  To be fair, I **was pretty explicit about having low confidence in plays this week due to FOMC flukiness**--and that this was probably the closest I come to sitting shit out without sitting shit out--but still disappointed.  I don't like to let the people down!

**Word of caution**üêª : Next week is **post-quad witching**, a historically volatile week for stocks.  For that reason I am still bagholding some VXX, choosing entries with caution, and keeping plenty of dry powder.  I don't care what Jerome says about inflation, this is not face-first YOLO time.

**Last week‚Äôs baggers:** Although the Tier 1 beating got most of the attention, **GPRO CS DB AAPL** all printed.  **VXX** on a ventilator but still (barely) in the game as of this writing.

SUPER consistent OTM call buying over the past two weeks.  Unsure if this RAMBO on Monday is necessarily THE catalyst but it's worth finding out.  Either way, you're rolling with a ticker that has seen some of the most frenzied UOA for a boomer stock this quarter.  It couldn't hold above 60 after the first run, so anything lower than that may be worth getting in to see if it crosses and if 60 becomes support after the event Monday.

DOCU has an investor day coming up with that peculiar post-ER timing that screams ""pump"".  They've really slid since ER, and are floating around that nice, easy benchmark 200 number.  Look to grab if it touches or dips below, and hold through the RAMBO.  This got me on board:

>Consider this: 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies and seven of the top 10 global tech companies all utilize DocuSign‚Äôs technology. In addition, 800 federal, state and local government agencies utilize the company‚Äôs platform.

Imagine them talking about that kinda shit for hours on end during an INVESTOR DAY.  Yum.

üêª: there is put buying around DOCU right now, could be hedging, could likely be during this week‚Äôs sell offs people dropped, but it‚Äôs there and subject to interpretation

# TL;DR

FB is the mall. PINS is Costco. Google+ created the wrong product.  


Pinterest 100B Marketcap by 2023. Think about who the customers are, what they‚Äôre doing, and why they do it.

# Purpose

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(DD in Draft Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Fastly DD in Progress)**
* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

## Investing in Internet Forums

Let‚Äôs keep one question in mind:

>Did Facebook‚Äôs implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user‚Äôs incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

[Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service](https://preview.redd.it/are6a4e5hxn61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=a547a926696fc0a7cc5fb3f7bdcaf78be4f7d684)

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

* Google is fueled by user‚Äôs need for answered information.
* Facebook is fueled by a user‚Äôs need to connect.
* Pinterest is fueled by a user‚Äôs need for ideas.
* Reddit is fueled by a user‚Äôs need for community.
* Online video games are fueled by a user‚Äôs need for adventure.

[The power of incentives](https://preview.redd.it/j4hi9w0ghxn61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7e4a2b9b600fa25459c8b19f9f433f47df30ae)

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming. I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.

## Searching

Consider this economic relationship.

>What are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a local-friendgroup site. As a result, Pinterest‚Äôs recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced **interests**, which we will touch on shortly.

&#x200B;

[An incredible economic relationship occurring at global scale.](https://preview.redd.it/6gz07fu6ixn61.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e467e4dc0ab9725cdd935c3eafe82495b7f487f)

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

\- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)

\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)

\- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)

\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)

\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)

\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

[Corsair Setup Ideas: note links to Wayfair and Reddit.](https://preview.redd.it/h3sro1lpixn61.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c76e8fc0d837b2cc8f174d31a771e587dd1f0ef)

The fact is, it‚Äôs the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest‚Äôs users are in a ‚Äúhigh willingness to engage‚Äù with things that result in ‚Äúaction‚Äù. **That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they‚Äôre getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.**

[Pinterest users have an incredibly high ‚Äúwillingness to engage‚Äù as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.](https://preview.redd.it/au1vvhl1ixn61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a149db0fd2a541da14c0b813b66b37ee661439)

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook‚Äôs connect-everything approach to social-networking.

# The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google‚Äôs results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security & Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user‚Äôs websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

[Progressing Web Standards](https://preview.redd.it/fitjijovixn61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fca3cb23f577904e044b7ec996fdfd2bdb87cfc)

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs algorithm‚Äù, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, DDash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet‚Äôs develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately ‚Äúaccess to information‚Äù, which is as scarce as ‚Äúaccess to clean water‚Äù around the globe. So it‚Äôs carefully considered in strong engineering communities. 

## Summary

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces; as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

I will not publish any graph since we all know by now they explain perfectly the past and are otherwise useless.

Instead, I will do a strategic analysis of why you should diamond hand on $AI for the next 5 years and live happy with the tendies you'll get from that.

Let's go.

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) is an AI service provider whose product is a stack that enables end-to-end AI in the Enterprise.

The takeaway from this is the word PRODUCT: go here [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm) and find that subscriptions are 86% of total revenue. That's it, its a product company.

The value proposition is straightforward: they offer a comprehensive platform to do AI from data collection to training models to deployment.

Nothing like this exists on the market.

They truly invent the Enterprise AI concept or at least the market will look at them that way.

Large organizations WILL buy into this stuff as they value having certified people (whatever that means) as they have on SAP, Oracle, AWS, GCP, whatever.

Large organizations don't want to hire engineers unless engineering is their core business. They want guys with very well defined certifications. Like it or not, that's the world we live in.

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) replaces all the opensource tech stack you need to do ML with a single, well qualified, vendor-supported platform.

If you wonder why large organizations use Oracle databases rather than MySql, you also understand why this will be BIG.

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) is delivering tangible business outcomes for its customers [https://c3.ai/customers/](https://c3.ai/customers/), and it is doing so strategically by engaging with fewer of them, but with a wide breadth of scope to build their reputation.

Talking about the strategic outlook, you should look on LinkedIn for the academic and professional background of the people they hire: from the leadership team to the developers, they are investing massively in talent.

57% of their staff has advanced degrees, most of them from the world's most prestigious universities, and many come from companies like McKinsey and Google.

The leadership team is super strong. You don't generally see that in a startup. I get the boomers' company comments being made, but as AI moves from recognizing cats to increase the efficiency of operations in Fortune 500, clients will value experience, industry knowledge, and all sort of stuff that these boomers have to offer.

The competition for [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) will come from GCP, AWS and Azure as they also start offering end-to-end data platform rather than other companies like Palantir. Having seen GCP, I would say that there is where competition is going to be. Azure and AWS are a long way from that level of consistency, according to my personal experience.

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) has professional services as well, but that's how you sell your product to start with to Enterprise before you scale through regional partners, which are here: [https://c3.ai/partners/](https://c3.ai/partners/).

The company has some legwork to do on partners if you ask me; what they really need is to form strategic alliances with global management consultancies of the like of Big 4 to start with. Having said that, don't believe the retards that say this is a service company here on Reddit. It is simply not true.

So what? Buy C3, and forget.

The opportunity is that [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) become as relevant as SAP in the following years as AI becomes as mainstream as ERPs.

Banana for comparison: SAP capitalization is $121B vs [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) $7B

My position in C3 is 70 shares @ 87, planning to buy maybe twice as that if it dips more in the short term (ALWAYS buy the dip).",1616194199.0

($RYCEY)",356,m8inij,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8inij/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_absolute_shittiest_company/,143,"Hi all, NrdRage  here. Just FYI, today's DD was going to be $RKUNY, but they had a  massive pop earlier this week, and the trade is no longer interesting in  the short term.  Then I thought $VWAGY, but the same thing happened on Wednesday. So instead, I give you this flaming bag of dogshit  instead.

What if I told you that you had the opportunity to invest in a company that has been around since 1906.  And what if I told you that this company, which has been around for 115  years, loses spectacularly large amounts of money - in fact, only  having positive earnings in two quarters since 2018? Oh, and they make  amazingly bad products which are shockingly unreliable, to boot?  Products that you can't afford and will never own? And that they've  diluted themselves to 8.37 BILLION shares of stock, absolutely none of  which is really held by company insiders who have an opportunity to bet  on themselves? Pretty amazing, right?

Let's talk about Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY), cause you're probably gonna buy some by the time this is over.

# Let's get this shitshow started, shall we?

So  all of you know them from their ridiculously expensive vehicles, which I  wouldn't take over a Honda if the trip mattered because they break down  so often. But consumer automotives  isn't really where they ""make"" their money - to use the term very  loosely. As a matter of fact, this company doesn't even make those  pieces of shit anymore - BMW does. No, these fucktards have 4 different  divisions: Civil aeronautics (50% of their revenue), Defense systems  (25%), marine and aeronautic power systems (20%), and IT-pee aeronautics  (uhhhh, math for smoothbrain).  In short, they're a defense contractor who also bolts on pretty  unreliable engines onto passenger jets to try and get you to Vegas as  you try to spend 2 days pretending  you're not some basic bitch who's gone from raging against the machine  to raging against the washing machine. Except you're not nearly as hot  as Stacy's mom.

# Pretend  I'm saying shit about their story and any unique aspects about them or  that anything they do is remotely interesting here. They don't, so I'm  not going to try to make it happen, but usually this is where I put  that. Moving on....

# Looking under the hood...or inside the cowling, as it were.

The  financials of this company are, frankly, abominably bad. They lost over  7 billion dollars last year. They operate at a negative-40% profit  margin. They have less than 5 billion dollars in the bank. In the immortal words of Spose, this company has the swagger of a cripple.  Demand for  jet engines completely dried up by the time Nancy Pelosi was trying to  get you to go to Chinatown to celebrate Chairman Mao during CNY last  year, and it only got worse the longer this whole virus thing dragged  on. No flights not only means  no planes and no demand for engines but, more importantly, no demand  for expensive maintenance contracts to keep those engines from blowing  up. 50% of their revenue comes from consumer air travel. Their forward guidance was some of the worst damp-handed beta cuckery I've heard in a long time.  They've already  come out and said they'll be LUCKY if they generate 50% of the revenue  they generated pre pandemic even after we get back to normal because of  the obliteration of business travel. They've diluted themselves into  oblivion, so they have to borrow money rather than raise it. And  countries not named United States of America have largely decided to  make up for their deficits in revenue as a result of completely  obliterating their economies by reducing spend in the military space, so  the Royal Navy ain't  exactly buying a bunch of their engines, either. The only thing less  sexy about this company is your wife in a negligee. Seriously, I get  that even ugly girls need love, but can't you put a bag over her head or  something? And one for your whole body too, you fat fuck. Oh, and did I  mention that they make mostly widebody engines in a world in which most  airplanes are going narrow body? So there's that.

More  importantly, even though the vast majority of the industry of the world  has kind of recovered their stock prices, RYCEY is presently at a  whopping $1.76, down from their pre-virus highs of about 12.50

# This is a joke, right? You're fucking clowning us to see how much you can get away with, aren't you you sick fuck?

Not  even remotely a joke. I mean, you are a clown, but I'm not clowning  you. I'm dead serious. Buying this company is a good idea.

Why?

Because  the saving grace their shitty products have is that their competition  ($GE, Pratt & Whitney - aka $RTX) make an even SHITTIER product.  P&W, in particular, has gotten under the microscope recently because  the 4077 engines they slapped on UAL's 777's started falling apart.  Remember this?

[Look out below!](https://preview.redd.it/7m9slpqjwzn61.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca799f0bbb649cf9c5b4448e52fe935994d35292)

$RYCEY  might be able to start putting their products on those beasts. $GE  slaps a GE90 on that same plane and, though thankfully none of those  have exploded yet (well, I mean, except for that one that got shot with a  rocket near Russia...but I digress...well, and I'm sure that Malaysian one that is chilling with Amelia Earhart probably exploded on impact), they're a maintenance headache.  On and on down the line we go, they've all got their quirks. Rolls, for  their credit, hangs its hat on their Trent 1000 engine, which is what  keeps the Dreamliners  in the air. Course, they're famous for fatigue cracking and have to be  inspected every 80 flights (down from an average of about 200 for the  industry) because they're so unreliable. Their one home run engine got  slapped on the A380, and then that whole plane got canceled like it had made an at-the-time milquetoast insensitive Tweet 15 years ago even though  it's the best bird in the sky.

This  is all a long way of saying they all have issues, but RR has slightly  fewer issues. Thankfully for them, airlines, not wanting to be sued, are  willing to pay up lots of money for service agreements, and that makes  up an insane amount of their revenue. You know, when the planes are  flying. One positive thing they have going for them is the A350 is going  to exclusively be using their engines, so they've got that going for  them. Matter of fact, they just recently locked down an exclusive  agreement to be the provider of that bird's engines until 2030 at the  earliest, which is a huge win. Plus it gives them time to figure out why their Ultrafan engines (which are supposed to replace the Trents) are such miserable piles of garbage.

# So why are they a good investment (and price targets)?

Well,  in practicality, they're not really, but in a market that is strongly  indicating it's way overbought, this is one of the very few companies  that hasn't had its turn at the recovery wheel on the stonk markets. With a 52 week  low of 1.31, they're presently only sitting about 40 cents off that  mark, and most of that has happened in the last couple of weeks. We've  seen the airline stocks start to fly recently, and $BA has been on an  absolute tear, so logically speaking, $RYCEY is kind of next soyboy up. Quick, name 5 stocks trading anywhere near their 52 week lows? Do I think they're going to get back to their pre-virus valuation of 12-16 a share? Fuuuuuck  no. They're really badly managed and air travel is forever changed,  which is going to really put a dent in their forward revenues

BUT....there's  not a doubt in my mind that they're going to see $3.40 in the VERY near future, $4 in the slightly near future and I would be positively shocked if they aren't at 8 by the end  of the year, which means you can catch a 4-bagger on these guys while  you laugh about how the absolute worst company in your portfolio is, on a  share basis, one of your best performers. Because laughing about that  is easier than crying about how your wife's boyfriend recently informed  you that he was upgrading to a 3.

Stupidly, my price targets are actually below that of most analysts, and those guys always undersell.

# Technical analysis:

There  is none! All my charts were for $RKUNY, and I'm not going to spend 20  minutes creating charts showing this thing's price action, especially  since the charts are ugly as fuck due to the fact that the stock only  moves in increments of fractional pennies in spite of having a 14 billion dollar market cap.

&#x200B;

OK ok, ONE chart.  This is a daily going back to last July.  Teal is the XMA and the dark blue line is the SMA. The nude line is a 200 SMA and not relevant to this discussion.  You can see it recovered a little (off chart) and then when ""wave 2"" hit, fell off a cliff again, and then gapped down hard at the end of November.  Since that point, it has largely been consolidating, but has tested the 1.31 low no fewer than 10 times, holding that support each time.  Since mid February, it's been on a slow but steady climb to fill that gap created in November at 3.40.

# How do you play it?

Simple: SHARES! It's the only way you CAN play it, because there's no options chain for this dog.

Ya  know, the longer I write this, the more it seems like I'm kind of  phoning this one in, but given the subject matter, I think that's  entirely appropriate. If you're asking yourself why, well, this one is  about to start making its climb upwards as more people start packing  into planes. Plus, until this whole Gamestop thing is over with, those fucking apes keep downvoting anything that's not Gamestop.

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* Shitty company....
* with even shittier competitors
* Didn't get to take part in the economic recovery in the markets; still trading a lot closer to 52 week lows than highs
* Has some guaranteed gubmint money, and is doing Playstation-like exclusives with certain planes for their engines
* Shares only
* Gives you the bragging rights of saying you're such a good investor that you made money on the dollar general of the Aerospace world

# Position Disclaimers:

\-500,000  shares at $1.72. Up until very recently, I was actually underwater on  this one (Edit:  As of this morning, I'm flat on it again). It dropped 11 cents yesterday and that was actually  significant enough to where it put a huge dent in the price. I have  absolutely no intention of buying more. This position represents less  than 1% of my fun money portfolio, so I'm not terribly interested in it,  but I know it's going to make me money, and that's all I care about.

About three ""bad"" stonks you know so well

It started not far back in history

With DFV, GME and me

I had a little cash, money for beer

Just my wife's bf given it to her in the rear

Riding across the nets makin bad bets

IRS's posse on my tail 'cause I'm in the debts

One lonely 'tard I be

All by myself without guarantee

The HF is beating down on my Banana hat

The sub is gettin' hot the stonk is getting flat

Lookin' for a call I ran into a put

His name is Cramer, He said, ""Sell"" I said, ""whut?""

He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed

Four decades in the market and that he's trying to burst

The stimmy's in my hand and he was on my tip

His voice was loud, his throat was dry and he asked me for a tip

He said, ""Can I get some?""

I said, you can't get none!

That shit made us madder

They pulled out their ladder

They were quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead

They put their games in my head and this is what they said,

""Now my name is Citadel, I've got a license to shill

I think you know what time it is, it's time to make a deal

Now what do we have here an ape and his fear?

I run this land, you understand, I make myself clear.""

We stepped into the market- he had a put, I had a call

You think we are over, you think were ready to fall

""Now I got the weed stock, you got the crew

We got two choices of what we can do

It's not a tough decision as you can see

You can blow it all away or you can ride to Mars with me""

I said, I'll ride with you if can get this order

KGriffen's after me for what I did to his shorter

I did it like this, I did it like that

I did it with a whiffleball bat

So the stocks on the run, now we're having fun

And right about now it's time to get some sun

The King DFV that is his name

And he knows the fly spot where they got the champagne.

We rode for six months the we hit the spot

The wifes were humping but the threads were hot

Their bf was staring like they forgot who we are

I made another post, just tryna raise the bar

GME Said, (Yo, you make this bid?)

I said, I did, then I ran and hid

(The bid said) Get ready cause this ain't funny

We're GME. And y'all'er bout to get money.

Pulled out the sell order we're aimed at the sky

We yelled, (Get'em up!) and let it fly

Prices went up and Hedgie's shit the floor

We wasted two months and we're back for more

""We're WSB. And we get respect?

Your cash and your foolery is what we expect""

GME. Was with it and he's it's my ace

So I grabbed the MM player and I punched him in the face

The MM player's out the play has stopped

We all got paid and the shills got dropped

Autists Grabbed the money (DFV snatched the gold)

I grabbed two million and a beer that's cold.",1616193115.0

BDRY buys dry bulk freight futures and gives the investor direct access to shipping rates. It doesn‚Äôt own stocks, so it is not affected by the wall street‚Äôs sentiment or noise. It follows actual rates, so, for someone who believes that rates are going higher, BDRY offers that simple pure exposure. If you believe that dry bulk shipping freight rates are going to increase then this is the only public investment vehicle available to buy. And the beauty of it? -> as an ETF you can always short it if you believe shipping rates are going to fall.!

BDRY is listed on NYSE and is the first and only freight futures ETF exclusively focusing on dry bulk shipping. A pure-play exposure to dry bulk shipping, an instrumental part of the global commodity market, uncorrelated to other major assets.

BDRY is designed to reflect the daily price movements of the near-dated dry bulk freight futures. It offers investors unlevered exposure to dry bulk freight without the need for a futures account. It provides transparency to investors by listing all its holdings daily. It is designed to reduce the effects of rolling contracts by using a laddered strategy to buy contracts while letting existing positions expire and settle in cash.

What‚Äôs the Investment Strategy behind? BDRY will hold freight futures with a weighted average of approximately three months to expiration. It intends to progressively increase its position to the next calendar quarter three-month strip while existing positions are maintained and settle in cash. The allocation is 50% Capesize contracts, 40% Panamax contracts and 10% Supramax contracts, rebalancing annually, as needed.

In my opinion, BDRY is the best way to capture the dry bulk shipping opportunity. What most people do is to buy shipping stocks. But is this the most efficient way? No, it‚Äôs not. Disadvantages of individual shipping stocks, other than liquidity, include company-specific risks, dilution risks as well as corporate governance and management issues. Finally, especially nowadays, it‚Äôs the broader equity market risk even though freight rates generally have exhibited low correlation to equity markets.

BDRY is a very innovative product in the world of shipping, transforming every investor into a shipowner that rips the benefits of freight rates through a much simpler and efficient structure compared to shipowning.",1616188722.0

Notice we've been in that bearish funnel for a while now, and will probably test $150 before too long. After that's completed, I'm expecting to see a lot of support down there, but also intense volatility.

Now, if that holds, we're gonna try to swing up out of the channel; if it breaks, we're going down to test $115 as well.

Reason why I'm expecting us to be down is due options behavior around the next expiration dates:

That's a huge short position expiring on April 1st. Also, notice how the calls/puts ratio drops from one expiration to another. To me this says people are waiting for the price to drop to get in cheaper.

What's it all about? **Fresenius Medical Care** is active worldwide in its own blood dialysis clinics. In short, if you've drunk too much varnish again, they wash the shit out of you. This happens in about 4000 clinics on (almost) all continents. The business is basically solid, crises have little impact because people keep fucking their health. The dividends are nothing earth-shattering but okay and were even increased this year. The parent company Fresenius is a stable global player and keeps making nice acquisitions and has good prospects.

**Why is it interesting? There were two dips last month in best Felix Baumgartner fashion.**

**Dip No. 1:** Because of Covid 19, business is a little worse because some treatments can't be done. Oh scare. The first part of the exploders shits themselves and liquidates the entire depot. Stock crashes from 65‚Ç¨ to 56‚Ç¨. Then people notice that Corona goes around at some point and maybe that wasn't so smart, so the thing flies back up to 62‚Ç¨.

**Dip No. 2:** The numbers have been released! For Q4 2020, the experts expect 4.49 billion in revenue, but it's actually only 4.40 billion. A whole 4% less in a massive pandemic crisis, what a scandal! The last hard boiled boomer break out in tears now and like in panic the entire depot is liquidated like piss.

They were so shocked by the figures that they accidentally treated themselves to a total of 5000 stonks. Could it be that, as CEOs, they know more when they put their money where their mouth is? Or have they simply sniffed too many sharpies? Certainly the latter!

There is restructuring and reasonable long-term planning at both FME and Fresenius. Two CEOs are flanking in nicely. Signs are that it is undervalued and a bargain.

I don't expect too much in the short term. If the news is particularly good, the stock could climb back up to ‚Ç¨65. But by the end of 2021 or early 2022 at the latest, it should be back at ‚Ç¨70 and higher. After all, this is blood dialysis, which will always be running, and not cars with screwed-up airbags, of which you first have to recall 20 million. In 20 years, when you're hooked up to an FME machine and die because you drank and smoked too much, you'll be nostalgic for the zarties this place made you. Diamond hands and perseverance prove!

**Risks**

**FME is of course attached to Fresenius**. One drawback is that Fresenius works a lot with credit and has a lot of debt, which is not a problem so far because of the turnover and the percentages, but if the credit conditions were to deteriorate, the business would also look worse. Overall, Fresenius is more broadly positioned and also includes FME shares, so if you want to play it a little safer, put some money in there.

In addition, Fresenius makes a number of takeovers and it is always possible that one will go to shit and fuck up the business. All that would of course affect FME as well. But I think even in the worst case the long-term strategy and outlook are right, so you would be condemned to hold the bag for a while but not have a total loss.

Since this DD has been written, FMC has climbed from 58.18‚Ç¨ to 61.64‚Ç¨ (about +6%) and was relatively unimpressed by all the corrections. Could perhaps be due to the fact that the boomers have already beaten the thing so much that there was nothing left to kick and spit on. Chapeau! This development and the fat insider buying at that time confirm my assumption that FMC was strongly undervalued (see DD). FMC still has a P/E ratio of 15.05 and now there was another fat insider trade of 600k$ last week and another 300k$ last month.

289,Why AMC is a BUY - An Employee Perspective,1200,m8ei9r,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ei9r/why_amc_is_a_buy_an_employee_perspective/,262,"\*This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor\*

So to start this off, I used to be a manager for one of AMC's largest competitors, Cinemark (CNK). When covid happened, my stock portfolio took a major hit along with the market, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been. I started to look for the companies that got hit hard by the pandemic, but would bounce back stronger once the country opened back up. I immediately had movie theaters in mind for some sweet investment potential.

In the past year, CNK hit a low of $5.71 and AMC went down to $1.91 and I had to pick which horse to bet on. I opted to go all in on CNK because they were in a better financial situation, and maybe I was biased from having worked there, but it made the most sense to me until all of this came about.

As AMC climbed up to around $20 during that initial wave, my CNK went up by association, I sold, and then I turned my attention towards GME midway through the first climb and made a quick profit. Afterwards, I returned to my original movie theater plan, only this time, I was all in on AMC.

In my opinion, AMC now has the highest return potential out of all the movie theater chains, even without the short squeeze.

In early 2015 and late 2016/early 2017, both Cinemark and AMC had record breaking years. CNK stock was 1.9x higher at around $45 and AMC was 2.5x higher at around $35. Business was booming, but it wasn't really because the theaters were doing anything different, it was because the studios released A TON of record breaking movies during that time, which brought in massive revenue for theaters.

39 of the Top 50 highest grossing films were released in the last decade and 38 of those grossed over $1 billion in international box office revenue. With all the huge upcoming films, and the ones that got postponed from covid, and all the pent up demand to go to the movies, I am very confident that this trend will continue and that we'll see new record breaking films over the next few years and even the next decade.

Another concern that people were bringing up is that streaming services and VOD studio releases are going to kill movie theaters in the long run, and I think that this is completely wrong. As I just mentioned, 78% of the highest grossing films of all time came out in the last decade. While streaming services may have replaced brick and mortar video rental stores, they couldn't replace the experience of going to the movies and catching the latest film on the big screen and the increase in theater attendance over the last decade proves it.

During AMC's Q4 conference call, the CEO mentioned that over half of their customers were return customers and that they were able to track this through their AMC Stubs memberships and from my time working for their competition, I can confirm that this was the same case over at Cinemark. We had dedicated return customers that would see a movie \*at least\* once a week, seniors especially. Those seniors fucking loved a discount day and they also just liked to get out of the house.

With the country opening back up, restrictions lifted, vaccines expected to be available for all adults by May, and 98% of AMC theaters to be open by tomorrow, that brings back the regulars which made up over half their business and everything is looking green in the months to come.

I am 100% ALL IN on AMC and I have full confidence in the stock, but let's play devil's advocate:

Worst case scenario, the big squeeze doesn't happen (it will), the company struggles to pay off it's debt while accruing more debt and then they start to go under, in which case, they will more than likely get acquisitioned by another company. Amazon, Netflix, or maybe one of their competitors, and then the shareholders see a nice payday. This scenario would take the longest to play out, which is the only major downside.

Realistic Scenario, the big squeeze happens, \*possibly\* even breaking the quadruple digits, apes get tendies, the stock normalizes, and we have a party in the ruins of the hedgefunds that dared to bet against us.

Best cast scenario, the big squeeze is fucking ridiculous, we all get super rich and buy condos on the moon.

In any case, the only way to make money on AMC is to buy and hold.

[Image is copied from one of u\/chayse1984's posts](https://preview.redd.it/j1sd6jde3yn61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d1d406b6d0ccc0b7b53c4f94f0cad9ee6d336a)

Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason, and it's not all *Brownian Motion* you stochastic cucks.

So we got two big fucking triangles up here, but do you even know *why*? Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.

It's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.

Almost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.

Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.

This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. ""Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?""

[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)

In PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.

You heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.

*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*

[From https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)

*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*

[An obvious short attack. https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)

*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***

Remember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.

# Boom.

Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**

Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this? Buy leaps on Fridays like these, and ~~sell~~ not buy weeklies during bull flags like this.

Tldr; Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.  If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS. üöÄüöÄüöÄs on  üöÄüöÄüöÄs on  üöÄüöÄüöÄs.

This is in direct reference to the DD that gained some traction here earlier today. The volume for GME is low, but this does not show in any way that supply is low. In fact, there's no possible way to deduce that from graphs like these. You could draw the conclusion that the high price is leading to low volume, but not much more than that.

I'm looking to see if anyone in the mortgage industry is aware of the ultimatum UWMC gave for mortgage brokers. Apparently they issued an ultimatum basically forcing brokers to choose between UWMC or RKT. UWMC is one of the largest if not the largest mortgage wholesaler in the country and RKT is quickly digging into the market share because they not only deal with brokers but also make a good portion of thier business being direct to consumer eliminating broker fees and passing the savings onto the customer. RKT made  the ultimatum public and thus there is a battle brewing between the two companies thus possibly taking a chunk of UWMCs customer base.

Because of the unprecedented run up there is ITM strikes down to $1... There is at minimum 100,000 ITM options expiring this week, definitely more than that but I wasnt gonna sit down and get more than a rough count. As the year goes on a metric fuckton will continue unraveling. Obviously a lot of people will be exercising these options but a lot also will not, expecially the higher strikes. Combine this with the market turning into this kangaroo shit show especially with tech and a lot of people might just take the cash.


I also cant help but think of the volume on calls once we get into mid year/once everyone found it it was free money to just buy tesla calls. I havent checked the chain but the OI has to be unprecedented in combination with mass groups of people discovering options and being locked at home.


Im just some idiot but cant this potentially be a giant derisking event?

Edit; just got bored and did next weeks expiring options up to $600. **There is 814,000 options expiring on 3/27 and thats rounding every number down so its actually more than that. There is potential of 81 million tesla shares smacking the market in the next two weeks alone.**

**TL;DR -** Primary Count is Green Crayon (Bullish) with upside targets of 220, 250, 275 and 335. Alternate Count: lower pullback for Green ii ok (non-standard)... as long as price stays above 172.50 wave ii is alive and does not invalidate. Only a break of 172.50 would put a deeper green 4 on the table (even  of Alt Yellow). No downside targets as FUD uncalled for with bullish count primary.

**Opinion (not advice)**

Today opened with a small pullback to make a lower low for Green ii (2nd waves are excellent buying opportunities). This is within $1 of the perfect .618 retrace target. Additional pullback is still ok, as could technically pull all the way back to 172.50 without violating Elliott Wave.

The rally and minor pullback leave us safe for now looking to complete a i-ii-1-2. Continuing to rally and breaking resistance of yesterday's high of 231.02 is key to this primary bullish count, with upside targets on the 5-minute micro scale for 1, 3, iii and (1) being 220, 250, 275 and 335, respectively.

But I must ~~caution~~: Wave i was a Leading Diagonal, which can look corrective. Of course ii has been corrective, as it should be, with all overlapping waves. A break of 172.50 opens the discussion to the downside in deeper Green 4 (or the Alt Yellow count with its greasy black peel). As long as we hold above that support, we will have plenty to talk about to the upside.

**My Position:** I added another 4 shares at $200. I'm layering in as I can now, because a break to the upside over $231 and the minor wave 2 pullback after that (maybe $220) may be the last good buying opportunity (not as good as now, but for those waiting... yadda yadda yadda). Ape Strong. I like the stock, I'm hodling. 

**My Opinion:** If you think this post is FUD, you spelled it wrong. Drop the D. If you are confused, see r/ElliottWaveTrading to learn the basics of how to read this.

**Also:** I will post the Bigger Picture (60-minute candles) this weekend after the markets close Friday. The upside targets are pretty awesome. (Sneak peek of (iii) is on the chart for this post. yw.)

An s&p 500 inclusion means institutions will buy in and shorts will be completely fked.

Requirements for s&p 500 inclusion: 

1. US company
2. Market cap > 9.8B
3. trailing 4 quarters profitable
4. enough public float (at least 10% of shares outstanding)

There was a rule change a few years back about multitiered shares structure which I'll talk about later.

First lets check the requirements:

1. check, they are based in michigan and do US mortgage business
2. total market cap is $40B, the current publicly traded shares total \~$3B. I will talk about this later together with the multi-tiered share structure.
3. they've only been public for 3 quarters, but there's no doubt they will be profitable the next quarter and beyond.

For point 4, we need to take a detailed look at RKT's ownership structure, which is pretty complicated. You can read about the details in their [S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm), but I can quickly summarize here (skipping over some details): Basically Rocket Companies owns about 8% of the whole business through class A shares, each with 1 vote and 100% economic interest (dividends); Dan Gilbert and Rock Holdings Inc owns the rest through class D shares, each with 10 votes and 0% economic interest. Class B and C shares were only used for IPO purposes and are irrelevant now. Class D shares can be converted to class A shares through holding units which will also convert the voting power and economic interest. 

There was a rule change after snapchat's IPO (where they issued shares with no voting power), that says you need a single tiered structure for your common shares (so that voting power is equalized with ownership) to be join the s&p. Preferred shares don't count towards this since they have no voting power. Right now RKT has these 2 classes of shares, so that's an obstacle to s&p inclusion. However, there are 2 key points that suggest Dan Gilbert will change this soon:

1. These classes are convertible. They created this holding unit thing already at IPO that can equalize the voting power and economic rights.
2. RKT approved a buy back of $1B over 2 years from Nov 2020. Their current public float is 115M x \~$23 = \~$2.65B. Now why would they buy back \~40% of the shares that they just sold in the public market within 2 years of IPO? No that doesn't make sense. They are looking to convert D shares and sell them. But they won't sell them in the open market and drive the prices plummeting; they are likely looking to take on more institutional partners. Dan Gilbert is really good friends with Buffet, and there was a rumor of Hathaway buying a stake in RKT. You get the idea. 

Once these things happen, RKT will be primed to be included in the S&P 500. When will this happen you ask? No one knows, but I think likely within the 2 year buy back period. So If you are long shares I wouldn't worry about the noise happening right now. I sold for some profit near the peak 2 weeks ago, still holding shares and leaps. I also think there will likely be a second spike/bleed up, and may sell for some more profit, but I will for sure hold some shares long term or buy back in at some point.",1616137203.0

When inflation rises, even if temporary, it will put additional pressure on tech / overvalued. Fed is in a rough position with yields and dollar given all the debt.

China will do well in coming years vs developed, particularly dollar-denominated assets. China stocks, despite the usual china shenanigans, are comparatively cheap. Chinese only have like 11% of their wealth in stocks, which will increase substantially, driving up multiples. If it drops with the market, it won't drop as much and should recover faster.

My plays: sell puts and covered calls on FXI. I'll plow the returns back into FXI to increase the money I can make. FXI has some tech too but comparatively undervalued tech (BABA) plus a 2.1% dividend. This will be my play this year.

I know China gets a lot of hate, but it's too undervalued given its economic position. The macroeconomics are just too much in China's favor, despite the known risks (accounting shenanigans, etc). I will start with a 200k allocation and should generate 3 - 5k a month through this strategy (18-30% return). If FXI tanks, which I find to be unlikely, then the financial outcomes worsen considerably with this type of strategy. Also, I realize that as VIX drops, the premiums drop, but I will play this while get getting's good. I'll reassess in a few months.

&#x200B;

Now, my reason for bringing you here today. Dashed line is a Fibonacci Retracement drawing, and the solid is a Fibonacci Extension drawing. If you don't know anything about Fibonacci, Google him. But that's irrelevant. All you apes need to know is this:

&#x200B;

Anything bouncing off that 50% *dashed* line, is a GOOD sign. It means that there's a strong chance the retracement has stopped there and will move upward further. However, that upward movement MUST be accompanied by volume. Without buy pressure, it will just continue to trade sideways between $193 and $230. To get AND STAY above $230 is key because for every resistance we break, the upward momentum will continue to carry the price of the stock higher, but again that requires UNYIELDING bullish pressure.

&#x200B;

Here's where it gets shitty. Overall, this stock is way way too volatile for it to follow trends and drawings like most others. Seeing it bounce of 50% over and over means it usually will break DOWN to 61.8% and if you don't know anything about Fibonacci, know this:

***IF IT DROPS BELOW 61.8% IT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY GO BACK DOWN TO A FULL RETRACEMENT (AKA $40).***

&#x200B;

Now, all this data is based on the last month, so this projection will only be good to look at for another month *roughly.* As I'm sure you've seen over and over, holding may not be enough anymore. We need bullish pushes to get over the next two resistances, and once we break those it's moon time. When/if we break $348 *consistently,* the next resistance isn't until $416, but with that kind of upward momentum, it'll easily get to $482.

&#x200B;

WHEN IT HITS $482, IT WILL GO UNTIL IT CREATES A NEW ATH, WHICH IS DETERMINED SOLELY BY BUY PRESSURE VS. SELL PRESSURE. And you can bet your ass the hedgies will do the same shit and try their asses off to tank it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'll say this to end it: The new ATH could  ***VERY REALISTICALLY*** be over $673 a share. It's also equally as likely that this retraces back to $40 a share because of too much sideways trading and no pressure to push past resistances. We need buying pressure, not holding, but holding is still good because it isn't promoting selling, and the more we buy AND hold, the less there is to short (excluding naked shorts which we know hedgies love).

2. **On the same thread look how gradual our movements are in comparison to the last run-up.

T**hat‚Äôs crazy, we are moving and consolidating in an extraordinarily impressive way. Some days, we even beat the market! Last time we had no support, no smart money investors, and no market makers that would even touch us with a 30-foot pole because of poor signifiers. This time not only are we building up strong, but we have also already seen a healthy retraction and amazing consolidation around the $200 mark.**
3. I know this is over talked, but the **new CFO in my opinion brings a lot of value to the company.** I hope that he will follow through on his promises and we will see a new chapter in GameStop!

Real yields of reserve currency sovereign bonds are negative and the lowest ever. Real yields of cash are even worse though not as negative as they were in the 1930-45 and 1915-20 great monetization periods. Nominal bond yields are just off the lowest ever made a couple of weeks ago. These extremely low or nonexistent yields do not meet these asset holders‚Äô funding needs. For example, pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and savings accounts cannot meet their financial needs with these investments so holding bonds assures their failure to meet their obligations. At the same time, while there is some room for diversification benefit, because of limitations of how low interest rates can go, bond prices are close to their upper limits in price, which makes being short them a relatively low-risk bet. The charts below that go back to 1900 show these things‚Äîreal bond yields, nominal bond yields, and nominal/real cash rates for the US, Europe, and Japan.

The economics of investing in bonds (and most financial assets) has become stupid. Think about it. The purpose of investing is to have money in a storehold of wealth that you can convert into buying power at a later date. When one invests one gives a lump-sum payment for payments in the future. Let‚Äôs look at what that deal now looks like. If I give $100 today how many years do I have to wait to get my $100 back and then start collecting the reward on top of what I gave? In US, European, Japanese, and Chinese bonds an investor has to wait roughly 42 years, 450 years, 150 years, and 25 years\[1\] respectively to get one‚Äôs money back and then one gets low or nil nominal returns. However, because you are trying to store buying power you have to take into consideration inflation. In the US you have to wait over 500 years, and you will never get your buying power back in Europe or Japan. In fact, if you buy bonds in these countries now you will be guaranteed to have a lot less buying power in the future. Rather than get paid less than inflation why not instead buy stuff‚Äîany stuff‚Äîthat will equal inflation or better? We see a lot of investments that we expect to do significantly better than inflation. The charts below show these payback periods for holding cash and bonds in the US, in both nominal and real terms. As shown, it is the longest ever and obviously a ridiculous amount of time.

\[1\] Based on current levels of 30-year nominal bond yields (treated as a perpetuity).

[\[2\] Bond payback periods are based on 30-year bond yields. ](https://preview.redd.it/lhvzs6osdun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2cd38430383dcb8343845f34377233c0c1a9f3)

**The world is a) substantially overweighted in bonds** (and other financial assets, especially US bonds) at the same time that b) governments (especially the US) are producing enormous amounts more debt and bonds and other debt assets. This is particularly true for US bonds. US bond holdings are over a third of global bond holdings held by central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and international investors with the next largest country/currency bond being euro bonds at only roughly 60% of US bond holdings. \[3\] Their overweighted position in US bonds is largely because of the ‚Äúexorbitant privilege‚Äù the US has had being the world‚Äôs leading reserve currency, which has allowed the US to overborrow for decades. The cycle of becoming a reserve currency, overborrowing, and being overindebted threatening the reserve currency status is classic. As part of this cycle there is the emergence of the currency and capital markets of the rising and competing empire. Consistent with this classic cycle there is now a shifting from US bonds to Chinese bonds going on. Chinese bond holdings held by international investors are rising fast, though they are now only about 6% of allocations in global portfolios. This shift is going on because a) global investors are overweighted in US bonds and underweighted in Chinese bonds relative to sensible criteria of what weights should be based on sensible portfolio-weighting processes, such as the relative sizes of their economies, their relative shares of world trade, and the relative sizes of their capital markets, b) Chinese bond and other capital markets investments are growing fast and are increasingly open to foreign investment, c) Chinese bonds offer relatively attractive yields with relatively attractive currency returns because of China‚Äôs favorable balance of payments conditions, and d) China‚Äôs currency is increasingly being internationalized. That whole set of supply-and-demand circumstances makes for a dangerous picture for bonds, cash, and currencies in the three major reserve currencies of the dollar, the euro, and the yen. If the new demand for these bonds falls significantly short of the new supply, which seems likely, either a) interest rates will rise and bond prices will fall or b) central banks will have to print substantial amounts of money to buy the debt assets that the free-market buyer won‚Äôt buy, which would be very reflationary (bearish for the dollar and the leading currencies who do this, relative to reflation assets).

\[3\] Estimate based on weights in global bond indices.

*If bond prices fall significantly that will produce significant losses for holders of them, which could encourage more selling*. Bonds have been in a 40-year bull market that has rewarded those who were long and penalized those who were short, so the bull market has produced a large number of comfortable longs who haven‚Äôt gotten seriously stung by a price decline. That is one of the markers of a bubble.

***Imagine what would happen if, for any or all of these reasons, the holders of these debt assets wanted to sell them***\*\*.\*\* There is now over $75 trillion of US debt assets of varying maturities. US Treasury bonds and notes account for $16 trillion \[4\] of this and US Treasury securities of other maturities account for another $5 trillion. \[5\] Holders of these debt assets will either hold them until maturity and endure the previously described terrible returns or sell them. Most holders of debt assets believe that they can sell them to get cash and to buy goods and services with. After all, the only purpose of holding financial assets is to be able to convert them into the buying of goods and services. The problem is that, at current valuations, there is way too much money in these financial assets for it to be a realistic expectation that any significant percentage of that bond money can be turned into cash and exchanged for goods and services. If any significant amount tried to make that shift a ‚Äúrun on the bank""-type dynamic would ensue. When such a dynamic - which I call a ""reverse wave‚Äù - occurs there is no stopping it. It has to be accommodated the way it was accommodated in the 1930-45 period and the 1970-80 period (and hundreds of similar periods throughout history) via printing a lot of money and devaluing it, and restructuring a lot of debt and government finances, usually including large increases in taxes.

\[4\] Includes notes, bonds, TIPS, and floating rate notes  ex-intragovernmental holdings. See treasurydirect.gov if interested in  more detail on the current indebtedness of the US government.\[5\] Note that there is additionally around $7 trillion of other US government debt held by internal government funds.

&#x200B;

**History and logic show that central banks, when faced with the supply/demand imbalance situation that would lead interest rates to rise to more than is desirable in light of economic circumstances, will print the money to buy bonds and create ‚Äúyield curve controls‚Äù to put a cap on bond yields and will devalue cash.** That makes cash terrible to own and great to borrow. Through their powers central banks can, at least temporarily, put a lid on interest rates and keep short-term interest rates low relative to long-term rates so that it becomes profitable to buy bonds with cash, which central banks abundantly provide which makes real interest rates very negative. For example, during the 1930-45 period the Fed kept the bond yield around 2.5% and the cash yield around 1%, which made it profitable to borrow cash and use it to buy and own bonds. While that can make holding bonds financed with cash profitable at low rates, under such circumstances both the cash rate and the bond rate are bad. Naturally, because cash rates are so low it pays to borrow cash and invest it in investments that are higher-returning. Back in the 1930-45 period, the Fed was able to keep yields there, and the way they did that was also through outlawing gold and the movement of capital elsewhere. So, when I look at it, while I want to be short bonds (because they have the most terrible fundamentals), I do know that central bankers can keep cash more terrible, and I do know that they might have to prevent the movement to other storehold of wealth assets and other countries.

Such moves would signal the beginning of the very last and most disruptive stage of the long-term debt cycle. So, watch central bankers‚Äô actions - i.e., see if they increase their bond buying when interest rates are rising led by long-term interest rates and when the markets and economy are strong - because that action would signal that they are experiencing supply/demand problems. Also, watch the rates of change in the injections of these stimulants in relation to the effects they are having on the economy‚Äôs vigour because the more stimulants that are being applied per unit of growth, the less effective they are and the more serious the situation is.

&#x200B;

I know this all sounds crazy to you. It sounds pretty crazy to me, too. However, I have seen this confluence of circumstances leading to this sort of dynamic many times in my study of markets and economies over the last several hundred years and I experienced this dynamic myself (in 1970-80).

## This Dynamic Is Typical of the Late Stage of the Long-Term Debt Cycle

Rather than being unusual, the dynamic I am describing has happened repeatedly throughout history. While I will briefly explain how the cycle works here, if you want a more comprehensive explanation, I will direct you to my ‚ÄúThe Changing World Order‚Äù study, which you can find [here](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).

Such moves would signal the beginning of the very last and most disruptive stage of the long-term debt cycle. So, watch central bankers‚Äô actions‚Äîi.e., see if they increase their bond buying when interest rates are rising led by long-term interest rates and when the markets and economy are strong‚Äîbecause that action would signal that they are experiencing supply/demand problems. Also, watch the rates of change in the injections of these stimulants in relation to the effects they are having on the economy‚Äôs vigor because the more stimulants that are being applied per unit of growth, the less effective they are and the more serious the situation is.

As explained over the previous few years that cycle is only one of the three really big cycles‚Ä¶

1. the credit/debt cycle,
2. the internal conflict cycle due to wealth, values, and political gaps, and
3. the external conflict cycle due to the leading world power, its world order, and its reserve currency (now the US) being challenged by the leading rising power (China).

&#x200B;

The ‚ÄúBig Cycle‚Äù dynamic of these big forces interacting is described much more comprehensively in my study ‚Äú[The Changing World Order](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).‚Äù I think it‚Äôs very important so, if you haven‚Äôt read it, I urge you to.

## Enter a Pandemic, and Here We Are

While the previously mentioned three big issues had been brewing for a number of years, about a year ago the world was hit with a pandemic (COVID-19), the economy‚Äôs pulse plunged, and the ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù ran to the patient and gave it a huge injection of stimulation. To get money into the hands of the people they wanted to get it to when interest rates were at 0%, the policy maker ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù had to do what I call Monetary Policy 3 (MP3). MP3 is the coordination of fiscal policy (in which the central government borrows and directs the money to those they want to get it) and monetary policy (in which the central bank prints money and buys the government‚Äôs debt). It classically comes when the more traditional policies such as lowering interest rates (MP1) and printing of money and buying financial assets (MP2) won‚Äôt get money to the people who need it most because the normal capital markets money and credit allocation process directs money to those who are positioned to make money and/or who have a lot of money rather than to those who need it most. That is the main structural issue that I believe has to be dealt with in the ways I explained in my piece ‚ÄúWhy and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed‚Äù and why MP3 is used.

&#x200B;

The most recently passed fiscal stimulus bill created a lot of funding and a lot of debt that is many times that which is needed to cover the financing hole (the ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù ran to the patient and gave it a huge injection of stimulation). Besides providing funds to deal with the economic consequences of COVID-19 it was a giant Universal Basic Income (UBI)‚Äîi.e., a giant redistribution funded by borrowing and monetizing. I‚Äôm not saying that policy makers should have done anything differently as I certainly see the need for such assistance and because it‚Äôs not my job to say who should get how much money and how policy makers should weigh the benefits of doing this against the costs of doing it‚Äîi.e., the implications of a huge amount of debt and money creation. I‚Äôm just a practical global macro investor focusing on the mechanics and its implications trying to stay one step ahead of the crowd, and I‚Äôm just explaining that these circumstances created a lot of government debt‚Äîi.e., because there wasn‚Äôt enough free-market buying of this debt, central banks had to buy it and had to print a lot of money to buy it with‚Äîso much so that they drove rates down to ‚Äúartificially‚Äù low levels, which ‚Äúartificially‚Äù supported financial asset prices. That move was a classic move. Now, there‚Äôs just so much money injected into the markets and the economy that the markets are like a casino with people playing with funny money. They‚Äôre buying all sorts of things and pushing yields on everything down. Now you have stocks that have gone up, and you have classic bubble dynamics in so many different assets. The following charts show the longer-term picture of the US government‚Äôs budget deficits (deficits are near WWII levels), the United States‚Äô current account deficit, and Federal Reserve debt monetization. It also shows how the US fiscal support compares to the rest of the world (much larger). While 2020 and 2021 were exceptional years that led to exceptionally large deficits (like the war years) these deficits are likely to remain large until they can‚Äôt remain large anymore.

In my examination of history over many centuries and in many places, I have seen many analogous cases, and by studying them have seen how  these things work, many of which are covered in my ""[The Changing World Order](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/)"" study.

## Looking Ahead and What to Do

Because I believe that we are in the late stage of this Big Debt Cycle that mechanistically works in the way I described, I believe cash is and will continue to be trash (i.e., have returns that are significantly negative relative to inflation) so it pays to a) borrow cash rather than to hold it as an asset and b) buy higher-returning, non-debt investment assets.

&#x200B;

Based both on how things have worked historically and what is happening now, I am confident that tax changes will also play an important role in driving capital flows to different investment assets and different locations, and those movements will influence market movements. If history and logic are to be a guide, policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won‚Äôt like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storehold of wealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets (e.g., gold, bit coin, etc.) and other locations. These tax changes could be more shocking than expected. For example, Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposed wealth tax is of an unprecedented size that, based on my study of wealth taxes in other countries at other times, will most likely lead to more capital outflows and other moves to evade these taxes. The United States could become perceived as a place that is inhospitable to capitalism and capitalists. Though this specific wealth tax bill is unlikely to pass this year the chances of a sizable wealth tax bill passing over the next few years are significant. Conflicts can increase in such difficult times when accompanied by large wealth, values, and political gaps, and the environment can become inhospitable to capitalists leading them to run from less hospitable places to more hospitable places.

&#x200B;

I think this is the new paradigm.

&#x200B;

**For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries‚Äô markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.**

I hope you're all doing great and have popcorn nearby for tomorrow.

Like last time, I am going to explain you what you can see on the different pictures step by step, or picture by picture in this case.



PICTURE 1:

https://preview.redd.it/wgfpkk1s4tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf17c0c0a7c6164dbd996fadbb783719340a079

In the first picture, we don't really see a difference compared to my last screenshots. We see a decline in sellers, which is obviously good, and a small increase of institutional involvement, also good. No negative data.



PICTURE 2:

https://preview.redd.it/hzvspcs66tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed4244b5cd2bcc90c1140300a0a0b9de9d3ac0ef

I find it quite funny, that we can see a spanish asset manager buying call options which also expire tomorrow. Just like the idea, that some of the hedgies want other hedgies to be smashed. They don't really have a huge position and won't have any big impact on the price of GME. All other options you can see are outdated and the accuracy of these options cannot be granted. Don't try to speculate, since you cannot tell whether they're still in or not.

For all of you who don't know what call options are, the spanish asset manager bets that the price of GME will be above 200$ tomorrow, which would definitely be amazing for us apes. I am explaining in the following pictures why exactly.



PICTURE 3:

https://preview.redd.it/opnh5k177tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bede88f52d218976b6f0cff114ba4ce8fa52d1b1

Okay so, this is where the important stuff is displayed. We can see that 11,681 options are expiring tomorrow if the price hits 250$, which is currently not the case. (GME at 211$ while I'm writing this DD). This would mean at this point over 2509 call options COULD, not have to, execute tomorrow ~ 250k shares COULD be bought. Keep in mind, that most people don't execute their calls, but rather just sell them.

Important info: I am only taking into account call options from 160$ - 250$ as you can see, since I didnt want to add all the amounts from 100$ to idk where. So you can expect that there are at least over 1000 options expiring aswell at the strike price of 100$. But I know some would argue about this, and this is why I am just calculating with the options shown in the screenshot.



SO: If GME hits 250$ by tomorrow over 1,2 mio shares COULD be bought, assuming that all people execute the calls, but this doesn't really has a huge importance since marketmakers begin to buy shares already in case of someone executes his options. 1,2 mio shares being bought at the same point, or even half of it -> huge price jump. But also 100k or 200k shares would create a price jump and therefore COULD lead to the so-called gamma squeeze (hitting higher stock prices, causing other options to be in the money, and so on). I don't say that it for sure will cause a gamma squeeze. It just could end up in the situation we're all striving for.



PICTURE 4:

https://preview.redd.it/t7m7flh59tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f98da6a0969261cbe0dc220bc4a1ef24ffb4b21b

Okay so, now we come to the point where you can clearly see why it's kind of important for GME to be over 200$ by tomorrow. If GME is UNDER 200$ TOMORROW, over 12k put options (1,2 mio shares) CAN be executed, which would cause a price drop. That doesn't automatically mean that the gamma squeeze possibility is non-existent anymore, but it would definitely mean that we would have to wait for the next expiration date to let it happen. It also doesn't mean that everyone really executes his options, since like I said, most of them never get executed.



Now we come to the huge BUT part:

IF GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW, WE HAVE NEARLY NO PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE OF ANY IMPORTANCE ANYMORE. This means, that there would really be no huge downward pressure on the price, outgoing from options, if it starts to rise. You can check this by yourself on other platforms. There are not a lot put calls on GME over the strike price of 200$.





Picture 5:

https://preview.redd.it/ofxur2biatn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=681866a6b46249f775ac5ddefd2c900cb4135d64

This is again very interesting imo, since we can clearly see, that the ETF objectives increased their positions by over 10%. OVER 10% !!! Since Blackrock owns almost 10mio shares which are mostly in ETFs (I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN BLOOMBERG RESEARCH BUT YOU CAN OFC JUST DONT TRUST ME. THEN IGNORE THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE) , I ASSUME that BLACKROCK (LARGEST ASSET MANAGER IN THE WORLD) is on our side and wants GME to skyrocket. Very good information, so do I think. We also see an overall increase in positions, except from one fund objective, the value fund objective (betting on stocks that are in their opinion undervalued). I know there were a lot of posts about Blackrock being on Citadels site. Which is just as likely. I don't have more information than you have. But Blackrock is the biggest shareholder of GME and has most of its stocks in ETFS.

The ETF increase could also just mean that another Hedgefund, not called Blackrock, increased their position in ETFs. Everything is possible.



Last picture:

https://preview.redd.it/7mlji2q9btn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=947b90a1993cf426da98ee679e8732a10dfd82e7

This really contains no helpful information, but I just want to show you that all short sellers stopped reporting short interest since the 02/26/2021 (When GME started to rise from 40$ on february 22nd to 265$ on march 10th.). Although short interest usually got reported on the 15th each month, we still have no recent reports. Seems a bit sketchy, imo. But this could also just mean nothing.



I don't want to get anybody buy GME due to my posts, since I am mostly making assumptions here and personally just find it really suspicious. I know we all find the situation really suspicious.



I THANK EVERYBODY FOR READING THIS AND WHICH ALL OF US GOOD LUCK IN THE WAR! I AM HYPED FOR POWER HOUR AND IF GME IS ABLE TO STAY ABOVE 200$. but keep in mind, we have many evidences, that other HFs are on our side, besides from my assumptions that Blackrock wants GME to skyrocket. Please read other DD's if you want to have more info about this topic particularly. I can recommend DD's by u/HeyItsPixel about this topic.



HAVE A NICE EVENING EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU ALL.



PS: Holy shit this really took me an hour to make.



EDIT: GME DOES NOT HAVE TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW! THIS ALSO DOESNT MEAN THAT ""GME IS OVER"" OR SOME SH** IF IT CLOSES UNDER 200. I WILL HOLD MY SHARES UNTIL GME HITS 1 MIL. I DONT CARE IF IT IS TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR. PLEASE DONT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I SAID THAT GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE A SPECIFIC RANGE**. I WANTED TO SAY THE GAMMA SQUEEZE IS MOST LIKELY TO EXPECT TOMORROW OR MONDAY WHEN GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW SINCE MOST OPTIONS EXPIRE ON MARCH 19th which is information we already had a long time ago. I held my shares while being at -90% and I will hold them until they're at +69,420%. My personal opinion.**

EDIT 2 : My main goal is not to motivate you, promise you anything or predict anything. My intention of my every two-day Bloomberg updates are to show you how the market does and if retail is selling or anything. That‚Äôs all. If you‚Äôre not interested in my text, don‚Äôt read it and just look at the screenshots and make your own opinions. I know, that not all options have to be executed and most of them probably are not being executed.

EDIT 3: I also did not say that Blackrock IS FOR SURE ON OUR SIDE, but Blackrock is the one having most shares embedded in ETFs. And as you can see, the positions in ETFs increased by 10%. This also COULD MEAN THAT ANOTHER HEDGEFUND OR ASSET MANAGER JUST INCREASED THEIR POSITION!! Don't get me wrong, PLEASE!

For real, it just makes me sad that so many people misunderstand me and think ""I am one of them"", ""trying to say that GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ tomorrow or it crashes"" or say that I said ""all options are for sure being exectued"". I never said such things and that was never my intention. I am not going to make any more updates.

TL;DR:

IF GME ABOVE 200$ PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF. IF UNDER: GET YOUR MONEY TOGETHER CUZ ITS A FIRE SALE

Channels:

There are two types of channels: ascending (rising) or and descending.

It is characterized by two PARALLEL lines from the highs and lows formed over the course of several days.

Once a channel is formed, a breakout either up or down the channel will signal a bullish or a bearish trend.

If the break is above the channel, then it is bullish (which means you should probably buy in)

If the break is below the channel, then it is bearish (which means you should probably sell or short)

https://preview.redd.it/iogosn3c2un61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=81663517c33234af961a4ff9c99f029b69bfa006

We see that GME right now is in a descending channel and it can break either up or down.

The breakout can happen tomorrow or in several days. We don't know. But once the price breaks the channel, we know if it will go up or down.

No technical analysis is 100% accurate, but it increases the probability.

379,Here's Why Hecla Mining (HL) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,17,m7yev9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7yev9/heres_why_hecla_mining_hl_is_a_great_momentum/,4,"A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.

For HL, shares are up 1.55% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Silver industry is up 3.14% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.69% compares favorably with the industry's 2.46% performance as well.

Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Hecla Mining have risen 81.87%, and are up 238.2% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 15.35% and 21.49%, respectively.

Investors should also pay attention to HL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HL is currently averaging 12,480,946 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HL.

Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HL's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.01 to $0.14 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that HL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Hecla Mining on your short list.

Disclosures: this is an article published by Zacks Research on NASDAQ ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-hecla-mining-hl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2020-09-01](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-hecla-mining-hl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2020-09-01))

Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. 

I want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. 

But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. 

So when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a support and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!

Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. 

Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be soon! 

As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! 

TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon. I like the stock and you should like it too.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out we shouldn't put dates on our analysis and I must say I agree. Although I see a very good chance of upward movement soon, we shouldn't link this to today or Monday.

Let me explain:

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) runs a 6.2 million square feet assembly plant. By September, $RIDE will be producing the world‚Äôs first full-size, all-electric pickup truck. As many of you know, Hindenburg Research, the group that took down CLOV, SOS, and NKLA now has their sights aimed at $RIDE. With the exception of $NKLA, most of the stocks that Hindenburg has attacked has recovered and many have gone on to double or even triple. It didn‚Äôt take Hindenburg Research to put a hit piece out on $NKLA to realize that Trevor Milton was a shady businessman. NKLA had no assembly plant, no product and no understanding of EV.

This is in contrast with $RIDE, why? 

The CEO Steve Burns is proven. He was the former CEO of WorkHorse, which had already produced EV-powered delivery and utility vehicle. He built the precursor tech to SIRI and has many other accolades.

False Narrative of Hindenburg:

1)Hindenburg states Lordstown Motors has ‚Äúno sellable product‚Äù and that they are ‚Äú3-4 years away‚Äù from production.

\--> FALSE. CEO stated on the Earnings call that an Endurance truck will be MASS PRODUCED every 6 minutes starting in September. BETAS roll off the line at the end of this month. The Endurance will be participating in the Baja race in April. Lordstown has innovated a hub motor technology that is the world‚Äôs first all-electric in-wheel drive system. It uses four hub motors with integrated software to ""give you a motor and a mind in each wheel."" Even if 1, 2, or 3 motors fail, it can still run on 1 motor (from the earnings call yesterday.)

2) Hindenburg states Lordstown Motors states that  ‚Äúno one will be interested in the Endurance.‚Äù

\---> FALSE. E-Squared Energy CEO said they intend to fill all 14,000 orders over a 2-3 year period.  Pickup trucks make up the first, second, and third best-selling cars in the USA. Even a little bit of market share for Lordstown will mean a lot. What about other comeptituion like Rivian and the Tesla Cybertruck? $RIDE targets a fundamentally different market. Rivian's pickup truck has an expensive base price of $67,500 while the Tesla Cybertruck is likely too unconventional for fleet owners.

3) Is the Endurance pickup truck all that $RIDE has?

\--> No. The CEO said $RIDE will be accelerating the development of a second vehicle, a van, and will start production in the second half of 2022, with an unveiling of a demonstration vehicle this summer. Camping World is teaming up with electric truck startup Lordstown Motors to develop a line of battery-powered RVs. $RIDE will also be manufacturing battery cells.

Evaluation:

NKLA Market cap :$5.92B

Canoo Market cap: $ $3.78 B

Lordstown: $2.2B

$RIDE has a $2.2B market cap, way less than NKLA and Canoo and betas will be rolling out at the end of this month and mass production will be out by September. Do you see anything wrong with this?

Analysts:

Goldman Sachs  maintains a BUY rating at $31. BTIG maintains a BUY rating at $40.

Let's talk about the future of the jackhammer market and what to expect for it. The global market is estimated to be around 202.8 million dollars in 2018 and is estimated to reach 361.2 million dollars by 2026, meaning it‚Äôs growing at a combined annual growth rate of about 7.8%. This is because they are durable, low maintenance tools and it is believed that there will be an increase in construction of roads railways and minerals. The graph below shows the one year market growth of Bosch Ltd, which is a top quality manufacturer of jackhammers among other tools.

1. Cybersecurity is a hot topic right now with tons of hacks in the news lately. This could be BB's time to shine depending on their growth with Cyclance and other security services they provide. 
2. They are now a pure software play and need strong double digit growth in order to be valued like a software security company. It currently trades at about 6x earnings which is quite a discount compared to others (yes, I know the others are growing faster).
3. Cash balance: Facebook settlement probably won't be spelled out in black and white, but if there is a licensing agreement moving forward it could be massive. Patent sales to Huawei should also provide a nice boost.
4. New and existing partnerships. It seems just about every week or two Blackberry is forming a new partnership or expanding existing ones. New revenues could be a turning point.
5. Amazon Amazon Amazon. The future is bright as they are essentially trying to create the app store for cars and use that data to create highly customizable experiences for drivers as well as selling the data back to companies like the car manufacturers and insurance companies. I'd also like to hear something about Amazon using BB to secure their drones.
6. BB has been in the limelight. Expectations are high and the stock has surged over the past half year but has been cut by more than 50% since it's 52 week high not long ago. They can prove themselves as a turnaround story and have a valuation that fits the narrative. 

TLDR; 

BB has a big earnings coming up. I'm in deep with calls expiring mid April and a ton shares. Good luck fellow apes.

My question is, if you run a financial institution, how do you not realize what advantages a hedge fund has over retail traders.


Issue 2: When he stated this, the interviewer clarified by saying hedge funds could buy a stock that his customers could not. He then babbled about how hedge funds had lost money as well.

This is a huge 180 and I believe now that we have spending fends in congress they really will spend a massive 2+ trillion dollar infrastructure package.   What's one major infrastructure that needs to be built?  That's right, 5 G Baby!  All of you with an Iphone 12 right now know how crappy 5 G currently is.  I think I get it for 10 seconds as I drive down I-35 in Dallas.

In comes American Tower - Ticker AMT.

First I'd like to point out that AMT has a social sentiment score of 100%... Out of the last 5 Analysts who reported on AMT they all said ""BUY"" with an Avg price target of $275.  Giving us room for a 30% gain from here.   The downside average is literally 1% higher from its current price.

Also please note how FAST it recovered in March of 2020.  I was shocked when I saw that.

My position is Oct $280 calls.  I believe congress approves a 2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill that has massive play for new 5 G towers.  If you are bullish on EV then you MUST be bullish on 5G.  (Plus it rhymes so that means it's going to the damn moon!)

I want to create a thread where we can have a healthy discussion of the potential risk of GME. WallstreetBets is turning itself as GMEBet nothing else. GME is not that relevant anymore in my opinion. Anything raising doubts or discussing potential downside will be downvote to dead. Whenever I reply to a comment will get the downvote attack as well. or fill with trash comments like apes can't read etc. It's toxic and unhealthy.  The posts that I put up got taken down in 5 seconds due to not enough popularity. How? Is that manipulation? or we need better training for the new mods?

I'm betting against GME with leap options as I disclosed before. So at this level, I think GME is dangerous and have more downside than upside looking at every single metric.

Here is what I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

* Next week post earning. GME is likely to announce a huge secondary offering to pay down debt and raise capital. This makes perfect sense given the amount of buyback they did in the past. This is a once-a-lifetime opportunity for GME which is great.
* There is no easy way to turn this company around. I don't say this easily, but EA has Origin, Activision has Battle Net, Ubisoft has its own, and Steam. How many of you are buying games majority from retail these days? I'm talking about the mainstream. Looking at those companies earning. There is no sign this will be changing anytime soon.
* I don't know the short squeeze gamma squeeze still holds, you can claim all data are fake, then I'm not sure why people are still living or trading in this country. Even the stock price is fake, it doesn't matter if it has a short squeeze or not. The big boys can just change the price like a video game. If you are on fake news and fake data camp. Please move on.
* Many big tech and great companies are getting hammered. Either people are selling to meet their margin requirement or reserving cash to buy the dip later, GME is not comparable to many of the good deals out there.
* SEC may be stepping in at any time for some actions, good or bad will impact the stock price. It's clear to me that there were many hedge funds were involved in driving up the stock price (P&D), there are still a ton of bag holders at the 300 and 400 levels if you disagree. So someone will definitely get caught for some illegal behavior at some point. There are 2 different kinds of hedge funds just so you know, the short that got burned, and the speculating ones that gain a ton off retail apes.

TL:DR

We're here at WSB is to try to make money and beat the market. So even GME was good at one point is no longer good at this level. If you disagree, but please be civil and nice. Bring up your points rather than trashing talks and attacks.",1616116298.0

Ok so I am on Webull and its apparently showing the EPS for this quarter. The screenshot here basically shows it all. Can anyone confirm this? or is it just a glitch? In case ape cannot read: it says the **ESTIMATED EPS is -0.437**, while it shows the **ACTUAL EPS being 1.27.**

There is a possibility that this is just a glitch as nobody has the earnings report (because it hasn't been released yet). Where could this number have been pulled from? why wouldn't that be the estimated rather than the *listed* actual EPS

&#x200B;

Now for some History:

Q1 2020: -$2.57

Q2 2020: -$1.71

Q3 2020: -$0.29

now for Q4 2020: according to the NASDAQ website, the estimated earnings is $1.46 eps ([Link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings)) 

&#x200B;

My opinion:

Gamestop will without a doubt have a positive earnings report. Will it be higher than the expectations? who knows. This may be entirely a glitch where the actual eps was inputed incorrectly.

I saw someone ask if they should continue to float their credit card balance to invest more into GME so I created this post to show other options to gain cash. 

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT  TAKING OUT LOANS TO INVEST IS RISKY AND REQUIRES PERSONAL RISK ASSESSMENT. These options will give you lower risk than a credit card. This is also what high net worth people do to take advantage of low interest rates and leverage assets.

With yields rising and the dip growing, now is a perfect time to gain some capital. There are 3 routes that you can do besides floating your credit card.

1. Taking out a personal loan (8-15% interest)

2. Collateral loans (4-8% interest). Example (what I did) would be to put your car or another asset you own up as collateral.

3. Home equity loans/ line of credit.

All of these outlets will provide you with much lower interest to get cash now while also improving your credit score as you pay them off.

The total process will take a few hours and you‚Äôll get the cash the same day. Banks will be happy for your business. I personally used my car as collateral and received $7,000 at 3.5%. The total cost of the loan will be less than $200 which I‚Äôve already made back.

Many people wait for his famous ""YOLO UPDATE"" that he posts every now and then.

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

One of the secrets to his success was... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

I won't let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).

No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.

I will **hold.**

We all know the electric vehicle market is working to replace the combustion engine one. This at this point is an inevitability, electric motors provide more torque and provide it instantly, outperforming combustion engines by design. The only thing it lacks is infrastructure which with emissions concerns internationally and the U.S.'s need to revamp existing infrastructure its safe to assume we will start seeing a major push for soon. 

Okay, cute infomercial retard, so why does this matter?

We've seen every major car manufacturer and even companies like Apple pushing to get in before the paradigm shift occurs in the vehicle market - and everyone's talking about who will win. I think this is the wrong way to be looking at this because what car is successful is going to be based on pure conjecture until its too late and the market is already flooded. What we should be looking at is what these cars need because there is about to be a MASSIVE boom in demand for the precursor materials associated with them. You can't build the Lego set if you don't have the right bricks, right?

This is where lithium comes in.

$PLL is based in the new ""Alliance territory"" that the U.S. is attempting to set up to remove supply lines from China. They've also netted me [Edit: +62%] already and I've been in for less than [Edit: two months] on this analysis. Every single car manufacturer is going to need materials like superconductors, processing chips, and *lithium*. Lithium markets exist currently for predominantly small scale applications, such as phone and tool batteries. The scale of revamping the automotive industry will near immediately exponentially increase demand for this material and the skill necessary to refine it into a usable product.

If you think my assessment is fucked up tell me where.

Also, if you know how to post screenshots or proof from the Chase app so that I can prove my position let me know that too because right now you're just taking my word for it.",1616110059.0

Option sellers have sold SO MANY calls on RKT for March 19th that they are seriously in trouble if the price moves! In fact if the price starts moving it's entirely possible the chain reaction can bring the price to the maximum strike, $62.89 at which point option sellers will lose **$1 BILLION DOLLARS...** They don't want this to happen!  


If you're wondering WHY they are trying SO HARD to keep the price NOT MOVING it's based on Max Pain Theory:  


*The Maximum* ***Pain theory*** *states that an* ***option's*** *price will gravitate towards a* ***max pain*** *price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an* ***option****, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.*  


The price of $RKT where there is MAX PAIN and OPTION HOLDERS LOSE THE MOST is $**23.89.**  


Very interesting how they are battling hard to keep the price here! Let's see the price as of 11am EST... **$24.22.**  


Most calls are at a strike of **$28.89**  
Most puts are at a strike of **$23.89**

Look at the massive options cascade that could trigger huge losses as the price moves up.

**$25 strike** has pretty big open interest of 38,349 followed closely by **$28.89** at 53,885.   


**TLDR:** We're seeing option sellers try really hard to maintain the price in a very narrow channel where they LOSE the least amount of money.   


This is pure price manipulation.   


If they lose control of even a few percent the options chain and gamma ramp can result in a potential $1,000,000,000 in losses for option sellers.

I found out about Wall Street Bets via the GME situation and I think I bought it at the most expensive price its ever been LOL. I understand that the reason the stock shot up in value was because of the short squeeze. My question is can the same thing happen to the Luminar Technologies stock? According to [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/lazr) it was 50% shorted this morning but this number is increasing (53% at the moment). However the business which creates sensors for autonomous cars has great growth prospects. The CEO Austin Russell, who dropped out of Stanford following a $100K grant from Peter Thiel, seems driven by his passion for science. This passion has translated into him developing high quality LIDAR sensors at a fraction of the cost of his competitors . The shorting seems speculative considering the company is increasing its business and currently has partnerships with [Volvo subsidiaries](https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/268323/next-generation-volvo-cars-to-be-powered-by-luminar-lidar-technology-for-safe-self-driving) and the Chinese automobile company [SAIC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/saic-motor-to-use-luminar-sensors-in-high-tech-line-of-vehicles.html) is now expected to start using LIDAR sensors in 2022. I'm going to hold this stock to the moon (I've bought 1000 shares so far) as the business is not going anywhere but I wanted to get people opinions. If wall street try any of the tactics they did with GME on this stock I'll be very happy as it means I can buy more at a great price. Unlike with the GME this stock is the future.",1616107920.0

All of this data seems like positive data right? So why is $RKT shitting the bed? Because hedgies are manipulating the shit out of the stock in anticipation of the 3/19 upcoming options chain. They need the share price to close the week low otherwise they could get squeezed. Read this post on what a sell wall is and how it works: (link will be in comments)

In conclusion, I like the stock long term on the fundamentals. I think $RKT is a solid company that is going to grow this year.

I also fundamentally like Jay Farner their CEO. He is an entrepreneur who has put 25 years of his life into this company and had a great interview on Fox recently.

$RKT is currently trading around 6X earnings. Wall Street thinks they are not going to be able to outgrow their performance from 2020. If $RTK shows growth this year, the stock has tons of upside.

They ended 2020 with 8% of the US mortgage market and plan is to grow to 25% by 2030:

\-One company rep that committed to buy 40 trucks through Climb2Glory told us: ‚Äú‚Ä¶**I‚Äôm not committed to anything, not to buying a single vehicle.** I committed to consider buying vehicles. I‚Äôd have a lot of questions before I commit to anything.‚Äù  
\- Former employees also shared that the company has completed none of its needed testing or validation, including cold weather testing, durability testing, and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) testing required by the [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/fmvss).

\- Lordstown only went public in October 2020, but in that brief time, **executives and directors have unloaded \~$28 million in stock.**

so it means stock has local and global uptrend after pandemic loses.   
3. day before yesterday we reached for me key level that was 11.90$ (the high before pademic starts and cant be reached while strong time of period)with natural uptrend and i think that this 11.90$ level is strong support line   
4. if you think that it is to late to go in position you are very wrong look at whole picture  [Amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)doing well after pandemic stock can't be downed by very strong short sell pressure    
5.for me target for this and next week target is near 26-28$ per share ( don't forget that stimuls that get most of Americans are going on stock markets and if you will make deep researches you will get more info that americans support  [amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)and there is idea that near min 10-12% of those stimuls will go in  [Amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)and so called penny stocks but reason why i trust in  [AMC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)is that it is not penny stock    
6.stock is going up and up every time and we really get chance to finally got short and gamma squeezed but forget about squeezes this is only chance nothing more.   


7. and finally decision stock is doing well stock is recovering after pandemic we are slowly reaching new key levels so  [amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)really have potential to grow natural like 70-90% up by end of the may or june so if we support this idea that will really increases our chances to get short and gamma squeezed it mean min(400-500% rise) but this is only theoretic idea to make it happend we just don't stop buying and holding this stock  [cuz ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CUZ/)it is profitable without gamma or short squeezes but idea that we can get to Squeezes it is so exciting    


so make always your own analysis and trade after it is your own risk to go in position i only sharing you what is my ideas    
i open first long position at 6.28$ and after that i'm buying and buying more when HF are making short sell pressure this give me chance to get some more positions at the dip

**RKT looks like a sterling investment and if you're going to own RKT you might as well own it now, cash out Friday, and then reinvest all of the gains and be even more rich when this Company is worth 12 figures** OR if investing isn't your thing, then I hear gourd futures literally cannot go tits up

tl;dr: 23M short shares are available to sell. If those are bought, plus whatever naked shorts they're willing to gamble, then the option chain powder keg gets lit üí•

I'm paraphrasing from those smarter than me (u\\jn\_ku u\\megahut u\\freakypheobe)

RKT is an undervalued behemoth so buy and hold shares in your 401K and you'll be rich sooner rather than later.

What is interesting for 3/19, however, is that the option chain is a powder keg. It is so explosive that MM went balls to the wall and just pinned the price so hard at $24.50 that it looked like trading was halted. They did this after

* the housing report came out bullish,
* the Fed said no rate hike,
* the Fed said they're going to keep buying MBS,
* RKT CEO said their competition's anti-competitive behavior backfired and RKT is doing gang busters broker business.

The obvious market manipulation is desperation because there are not enough shares to cover those calls. There may be 15% to 30% (16M - 30M shares) of free float.

So why $24.50, because any lower and they're negative on the puts, any higher sets off a chain reaction where $25c print, then $27c, then $30c. We're sitting at Max Pain. Here is the detonation sequence:

* At $25.50, there are 8M shares ITM
* At $29, there are 20M shares ITM *...there may be only 16M shares in free float*
* At $32, MM may have to buy up ALL of the synthetic longs to cover the options

If those calls are ITM and naked (I'm thinking they're naked), the option writers will be margin called. Not *can* be margin called, they *will* be because these are monthly contracts and liquidity can be called on option contracts T+2. That ""T"" is Friday for DTCC and brokers are not holding the bag so they're margin calling as soon as contracts turn red.

So how do we move the price up $1 dollar. One! Solitary! Dollar! to start the lunch sequence? We have to blow past the sell walls that are floor to ceiling shorts. There are 15M shorts ready to be sold and another 7M that are ready to be borrowed. If those shares get bought, then it's just naked shorts and price gains while the option writers shit their pants waiting for the phone to ring

THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post. DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.  

**TL:DR:** **I'm still buying GME, but these guys may get another month. Option positions appear to be rolling over to April 16, 2021, but at some point these shares are going to have come back home.** Look at the data and draw your own conclusions. I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm a legit autist who found out I can export a lot of shit out of thinkorswim, had Excel for work, and made nice curves. I'd like smarter apes to help me interpret the data since I'm not entirely sure my analysis is correct so please leave your thoughts in the comments. I encourage criticism, but read the disclaimer at the end of the post for stuff, which I will repeat as a comment and respond to that. 

Summary:

1. Total Exposure to short positions on options stayed relatively constant at **$2.5 billion** as compared to yesterday. This is consistent with price action which was also relatively flat. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1.
2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$880 million** down from $889 million--a 1% decrease. *See* Table 1.
3. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover all short positions on ITM options decreased by about 400,000 shares to **11.4 million shares (21% of total float)**. *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. 
4. This was almost entirely due to a decrease in the number of shares to cover Friday's ITM positions, which is down about 350,000 and is now **2.893 million shares (5.34% of total float)**. It appears, at first, glance that several options were rolled over to OTM positions in later months. There is no telling how long this can go on (which is a common criticism from yesterday). 
5. The ""Minimum Exposure Point"" for this Friday's options is steady at 150. *See* Table 2, bottom of blue curve on Figure 1, and where curve crosses 0 on Figure 2. For most stocks, having a price that is significantly above this price is usually a **bearish** sign because it means there are a lot of incentives from people with a lot of money on the line to move the price of GME to that point. It also tends to be the point where smart people who buy options have indicated they ***think*** the price is going to land. That said, I'm not sure how strong incentives are for that to happen--it would only decrease exposure from $880 million to $800 million. It is still a lot of money.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This whole exercise was the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, I acknowledge that this is not realistic. Market makers and the like are not a monolith and they are constantly supposed to be hedging all of the time. This is a major weakness of this curiosity because it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders. 

The reason I didn't keep this to myself, though, is that I need smarter folks to explain to me why there is such a huge deviation between the minimum exposure point (Table 2) for options expiring on Friday and the share price. For most stocks, there is not a deviation and if there is, it isn't this big and it doesn't last for multiple days on end.",1616104462.0

Yes, he has stories. Yes, he USE to be a broker, and Yes he's got some decent info about GME.

&#x200B;

He also runs a memebr only Youtube site that makes you pay to make a comment on his page. He only reads super chats, and has NO insight or desire to look at any other stocks his members ask of him. He glances over anything that isn't GME, a complement about him, or just tries to sell him merch.

He's been asked about RKT, he didnt know about it. He was asked about CCIV..never heard of them. He was asked about AMC, and he bashes it, using his own opinion without any Technical Analysis to back it up. He doesnt do any DD, even when it comes to GME. He has nothing but guesses about where GME might go in the future. Can GME get into game streaming? Maybe. Wonder is he's heard about Steam, Stadia, Xbox Pass or PSN? Will GME get into eSports? Wonder if he knows about MTG?  

This guy is nothing but a one trick Pony. Once the GME bubble pops, he's gonna disappear, unless cruises start back up, which they wont for a while. And even then, he's always talking about how he sets up groups to go on cruises with him but only so he and his wife can get a free room. 

Does he know his Poop about GME?  Yes he does. If you're in GME and only GME, watch him. 

Lets be honest, if you're only in GME, then fuck me, why are you investing?

You're better suited to watch Treys Trades, AndrewMoMoney, StockMoe, Max Maher, Matt Kohrs..and really a handful of any other youtubers. Most of these guys are transparent about who they've invested in. 

Not only do  they all look at other stocks, they actually answer their viewers questions, and they educated you.

Bruce (not calling him uncle, cause uncles are suppose to be helpful, like Uncle Ryan) just reads super chats, and tries to sell his personal advice for $400 an hour. How can someone who no longer invests give advice? How can someone that hasn't heard about CCIV, RKT, HCMC, and whatever is at least being talked about all over the place advise people with their money?  Would you go to GME for advise about real estate?

I'm sure I'll get some flack for bad mouthing Bruce, and I'm sure he'll have some sort of excuse or reasons for all this, and I'd say some of  this in his channel but I'm not joining his group and give him money to just glance over Super chats.

***Download link at bottom, contains the complete list of 13F, D/G and NP filings for $GME***

Two things, while short positions are not reported in the 13F, as Ms Alexis Goldstein (u/dontfightthevol) has pointed out,  however the PUT options hedgies hold are indeed included.

Institutional Ownership over 100% is not a hedgies conspiracy, Example of other stocks with over 100% ownership such as Paypal and Salesforce

PYPL : Institutional Shares	1,364,784,714 - 116.48% (ex 13D/G)

CRM : Institutional Shares	1,049,782,250 - 114.73% (ex 13D/G)

The over 100% ownership report can be caused by the following

**1. Different Report Type**

**13D and 13G**

The 13D and 13G forms are ""beneficial ownership"" forms. The primary purpose of these forms is to understand control of a company. To that end, the 13D and G forms do not just disclose the shares directly held by an investor, but also shares indirectly held (but controlled) by that institution. These indirect shares include all the shares held by the clients of financial advisors. Another requirement of the beneficial ownership forms is that they include related parties to the funds.

For example, the firm called ""Point72"" that you are probably most familiar with is Point72 Asset Management, LP. However, there are also related entities Point72 Capital Advisors and Point72 Asia (Hong Kong) Limited. When Point72 Capital Advisors files a 13G, these related parties might also be found on the filings. For an example of this, see this 13G filing for Pacira Pharmaceuticals. If you look at that 13G, you'll find five different entities listed on that filing (including Steve Cohen).

**13F**

In comparison, the 13F filings are not as concerned with disclosing the control of a company, but rather the holdings of a fund. Every fund with over 100M assets under management is required to file a 13F that discloses their positions. The types of securities disclosed in this form include long equities, call options, and put options. Short positions and cash are not disclosed. One of the key differences between the 13D/G filings and the 13F filings is that whereas the 13D/G filings can be made as groups (with related parties), the 13F filings can not. This means that there are frequent instances where a insitution might file a 13G and a 13F diclsosing different shares for the same security.

**NP**

Form N-PORT is the reporting form that is to be used for monthly reports of Funds other than money market funds and SBICs under section 30(b) of the Act, as required by rule 30b1-9. under the Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-9). This form, filed by registered management investment companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) organized as Unit Investment Trusts, is used to report on a fund‚Äôs portfolio. Money market funds and small business investment companies (SBICs) are excluded.

&#x200B;

**2. Different Filing Date and deadlines**

The deadline is for Date X for the effective Period Y. For example Fund A submits it's report at 1/26 then later sold it on 2/1, filed the report on 1/27. Fund B bought it at 1/27 and filed the report at 2/3. When financial data service tally all the report it sometimes tally both holding on Fund A and Fund B.

**Filing Deadlines**

* 13F - Within 45 days after the end of each quarter.
* 13D - Within 10 days of owning 5% of a company, and within 10 days of any material change thereafter.
* 13G - Annually on February 15.
* 4 - Within 2-3 days of the transaction.
* NP - Last business day of every month

&#x200B;

**4. Short selling (What** ü¶çü¶çü¶ç **want to hear)**

Assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)‚Äîor 125% (25 √∑ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.

502,The UWMC rocket,1530,m7plal,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7plal/the_uwmc_rocket/,501,"First off: I'm very bullish on GME, and I won't sell a single share for this play. However, I had some cash laying around in my brokerage account that I owe in taxes. And I don't want to feel any pressure about the squeeze having to happen before X or Y, so that money won't be going into GME. The squeeze will happen when it happens, and I can confidently say I can hold my shares for however long I need to do so.

So during the last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve seen UWMC being mentioned here. From what I understand, the company has pretty good fundamentals. They‚Äôre profitable, yada yada yada. However, I‚Äôm not looking for boomer stocks that give me a few percent of profit a year. I like rockets.But among the posts about UWMC, people were mentioning that there were a lot of options expiring on Mar 19. This piqued my interest. And I decided to take a look at the options chain myself.

I ran a script to collect the data from the Yahoo options chain on Mar 7th, and quickly realized that there are indeed a shit ton of calls. This is not a boomer stock. This is a rocket, primed for launch. I figured someone else was going to post about the options chain in a more exhaustive manner, but this never happened. However, the last date for optimal launch conditions is drawing close, and the stock price is finally seeing some nice upwards action. So I figured I'd take it upon myself to tell you all about the beautiful options chain.

Now, before we start, I should mention that my understanding of options is rather limited. Prior to the whole GME thing, ‚Äúoptions‚Äù primarily made me think about the menu where you can change the graphics fidelity and your controls in a videogame. So keep that in mind as you read this. I‚Äôm not the ideal person to be posting this.

The UWMC options chain had (as of Mar 7th - sorry about the outdated data, didn‚Äôt run the script since then, and the Yahoo IV seems to be scuffed right now) a total of 501,471 calls, with strike prices ranging from $1 to $25. As we all probably know by now, each call contract is worth 100 shares. This means that there were call contracts out there worth 50,147,100 shares.For a stock which has a public float of only \~90 million. Let that sink in. There are calls for literally 55% of the float.

I also went ahead and calculated approximate deltas for the various calls in order to calculate to which extent these calls are likely hedged. With the price at the time ($8.68), roughly 11.3 million shares would have been held by call writers, assuming all of them hedge according to delta, and calls worth 38.9 million shares would have been unhedged.

At a price of $10, the number of hedged shares should go up to roughly 16 million.

At $12, that number would be \~23 million.

At $14, \~28.9 million. At this point, there are still \~21.2 million shares that are unhedged.

And this just keeps going as the price reaches new heights. Basically RKT all over.

Now, the deltas would be slightly different today seeing as the delta calculation takes time until expiry into account, and a lot of the calls expire tomorrow, but the situation should still be *very* similar. Also, all of the calls aren‚Äôt written by market makers or by people who delta-hedge, but from what I understand, Market Makers do write the majority of call options.

TLDR:There are call options out there worth roughly 55% of the public float of UWMC. Potential for a massive gamma squeeze starting if the price goes up just a couple of dollars. EZ 2-bagger *with shares* before the week is over.

If the price doesn't go up soon enough, UWMC is apparently still a solid company, according to other posts on this sub. Boomer profits, maybe a 2-bagger with shares before the year is over.

Positions: 150 shares @ $9.06. No options because I‚Äôm not rich enough to set up an account at an american broker, and I can‚Äôt find any european brokers that offer options for american stocks.

This is obviously not investing advice. I barely understand how options work, and eat crayons for breakfast.

Edit: Market is open, yahoo IV is unscuffed. So I could get some fresh data.

Total open interest  is 543,817 for calls across all strike prices and dates. Table below is assuming 100% of calls are hedged according to delta. This is obviously not the case in reality, but I'm not sure what percentage would be a reasonable assumption, so just posting the raw results from my script here. Also, keep in mind my deltas aren't 100% correct, but rather just approximations. I'm too smoothbrained for using the real black-scholes algorithm.

CNBC video:¬†/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM¬†- duration 04:17:58

We're missing about 20 minutes.

""Ahh, you crayon-eating poop-brain, they edited out all the cuts, breaks and stuff like that"" I hear you saying. Yep! But also, CNBC fucks also did some extra shillwork on it.

At 02:38:19 (original video) - French Hill comes on and during his 5 minutes, he has doubts about separation of Citadel's businesses.¬†In the CNBC version THERE IS NO FRENCH HILL. ERASED.

At 02:45:59 (original video) - Cindy Axne comes on and during her 5 minutes asks about RH and Citadel's spreads, business practices.¬†CNBC keeps about 5% of her time in their version of the video, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS CUT.

You can go check it out yourselves, it's there for everybody to see.

We already knew they weren't clean, but tampering with a congressional hearing video? Is it just me or do you also smell desperation?

Good detectives follow facts and pieces of information objectively to arrive at the next puzzle piece in order to solve a crime. Bad detectives have a preconceived notion as to what happened and who might have did it based on their first few minutes at the scene. Then the bad detective forces evidence to fit their narrative instead of letting facts lead the way.

 I read every single DD post on here and love it. No two approaches are the same and have found that one of the only commonalities between them all is an objective/unemotional point of view. This is my problem. How or what is the trigger for identifying tickers worth spending days or weeks of research on?

518,Rkt gamma,131,m7n4nn,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7n4nn/rkt_gamma/,37,"So, the thing I have found interesting about the Gamma ramp on RKT is just how dense it is.

70% of the float is owned by institutions, so those share won't actually move when a call is executed. 

Now, lets assume retail owns, what, 15% of the float. 

So, based on the Gamma ramp, if the price of the shares is ~$25.50, the call sellers need to hedge with the remaining 15% of the free float. 

Meaning there are zero free shares. 

If it goes to $32, then the call sellers need to hedge with 30% of the float... Which is impossible without them buying up all the remaining shares sold short. 

So, yeah, if we get massive buying going on RKT, the call seller (most likely Citadel), could probably be bankrupted this week. 

After all, they have a legal obligation to deliver those shares, NO MATTER THE PRICE. 

Right now, at the current price, there are roughly 80,000 calls in the money, meaning they will need to deliver, potentially, 8m shares by Tuesday. 

If it hits $28.89+0.01, that number jumps to like 200,000 contracts, or 20 million shares. 

In the unlikely event it hits $38.89, that is another 65,000 ITM contracts, bringing us to 26 million shares. 

... And now you see why they NEED the price lower. There just aren't enough shares available to deliver.

523,Nokia CMD Forward Guidance (Quite Disappointing),31,m7mbgt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7mbgt/nokia_cmd_forward_guidance_quite_disappointing/,9,"I have written about Nokia a few times since Nokia is about 90% of my portfolio (other 10% is GME) and I have read about and researched them quite extensively.

The forward guidance is released before the CMD webcast and unfortunately I am very disappointed.

Since, I wrote some posts when I was quite bullish, I thought I would write another one when the reality slapped me in the face:

The numbers I've had in my spreadsheet for Nokia's Est. Revs, OMs and FCFs until 2025 are pretty close to what this article states. Differences are: I had Network Infrastructure growing at 3% and Mobile Networks having 6-8% OM in 2022, 10% in 2023, 12% in 2024 and 13-15% in 2025. I had the short & mid term OMs for Infrastructure at 10% and C&N Services at 7.5%. These were just educated guesses based on how Ericsson increased their margins based on how they grew their business and reached a certain number of live networks and Pekka's webcast in December.

Unfortunately, the margin (5-8%) on the Mobile Networks division in 2023 is not good enough imo. This division earns about 50% or about 10 billion Euros of Nokia Group's annual revenues and this type of low margin is not acceptable especially comparing them to their rival Ericsson. We'll see how the market reacts and how the presentation goes but personally I am disappointed with that percentage for 2023.

Overall, Nokia's share price is still quite lower than where it should be. However, I am not as bullish as I was before. We could probably hit double digits within couple years but barely so. With 5-8% margins on MN, I don't believe $15-20 is realistic anymore. The margin provided is especially concerning to me since the growth and margin on the enterprise subset is so healthy. CSP part seems to be a bigger S.S. than I expected which is very unfortunate.

I am going to listen extra carefully when Pekka talks about the Enterprise market. I hope these numbers are too conservative however I believe not. He talked about transparency quite often and I think Pekka is being honest with us and providing numbers that Nokia is very likely to achieve. I am sure he is leaving some room for upside potential but I don't believe it's much.

Any opposing views? I would love to  hear about other people's interpretations on these numbers.

&#x200B;

Update: 

I updated my Excel spreadsheet with the numbers that were provided during the CMD from Nokia executivies.

As of right now, Nokia should be worth about $6.50 based on competitor Ericsson's PE ratio, Nokia's 2020 non-IFRS earnings per share.

Based on the revenue and OM%s provided in the webcast, I expect Nokia's earnings per share to be:

2021: 0.25 Euros

2022: 0.37 Euros

2023: 0.38 Euros

2024: 0.42 Euros

2025 0.44 Euros

Based on the current exchange rate, Nokia share price should be approximately:

2021: $6.5

2022: $9.5

2023: $10

2024: $10.75

2025: $11.50

I am basing these solely on EPS and PE ratios of Nokia's competitors. 

For Mobile Networks, OM% for 2021 is calculated at 0%

2022 at 5.5%

2023 at 6.5%

2024 at 8.5%

2015 at 10%

Based on What Pekka Lundmark and the team talked about during the webcast, I believe these numbers are conservative.

Even though 2023 share price is well below what I hoped for, it is still way above current levels. 

Considering the clearly positive cash flows, increasing margins, there is no reason for this stock to trade as if bankruptcy is an option.

Hopefully, the analysts will revise their price targets and we see some appreciation in the share price this year.",1616084820.0

Unfortunately, common knowledge isn‚Äôt always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don‚Äôt really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) ‚Äî [Source ‚Äî 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)

There are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.

Regardless, I‚Äôve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled ‚Äî often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that‚Äôs fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it‚Äôs important to know how you‚Äôre being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I‚Äôll be addressing [this post ‚Äî 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I‚Äôll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.

**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**

There does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn‚Äôt imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It‚Äôs not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) ‚Äî [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) ‚Äî notice how RIOT‚Äôs peak in 2018 coincides with SPY‚Äôs trough? That‚Äôs correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can‚Äôt say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a ‚Äústore‚Äù of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.

What I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I‚Äôve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm working on an iPad here ‚Äî cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.

For the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I‚Äôll provide. I can‚Äôt post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.

Note: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim ‚Äî 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB‚Äôs mods similarly dismantled.

**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**

The post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.

**Claim #3: No seriously, these ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**

Do you know what you get when you Google ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù were a real phenomenon, you wouldn‚Äôt have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.

**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME‚Äôs rise!**

People who make this claim often resort to proving it by:

* using complex calculations

* depend on incomplete data

* make suppositions

* discard any data that disproves their claims

[Source ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)

However, we don‚Äôt need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn‚Äôt have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.

Here, we have a few important metrics:

*Short interest ‚Äî 16% ‚Äî the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float ‚Äî while 16% is atypically high, it‚Äôs nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.

* Borrow rate ‚Äî 0.6% ‚Äî particularly low. Borrow rates ‚Äî that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis ‚Äî go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.

* Borrow availability ‚Äî 300,000 shares ‚Äî the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as ‚Äúno shares available for shorting‚Äù for a long time ‚Äî *days, even* ‚Äî since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.

So there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam‚Äôs Razor, y‚Äôall](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**Conclusion**

Now you have to ask yourself ‚Äî do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it‚Äôs the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it‚Äôs the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don‚Äôt lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers. It‚Äôs immoral,  and it;s not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is ‚Äútl;dr, buying more‚Äù.",1616078822.0

A small write-up on a good swing play for Disney!

I previously written up on bullish semiconductor stocks, bullish PLUG, and bearish cloverhealthcare and have been for the most part correct on those (anyone who followed those plays should have made tendies :\] ).

For Disney $DIS I see it hitting 200 and maybe as high as 210 in the distant future.

Disney is in a good position for further growth. They are now multi-faceted. You can consider them a **technology** stock with high growth (i.e DIS+, HULU), **entertainment** **and** **news** stock (i.e ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney being the obvious), or even a **reopening** play (i.e their amusement parks, cruiselines, shopping districts).

Their latest earnings report was excellent, but was overshadowed by the nasty drop in tech stocks the last month. Even then, DIS hardly dropped and is reclaiming the 200$ price point.

UBS has a price target of 200$ with the average price targets totaling to 205 according to FinViz.

Catalyst --> DIS to reopen parks in California by April 30. This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it's online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I'm from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott's berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.

Meanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has ""hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.""

I believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.

My current positions: DIS 4/16 200C's",1616078788.0

**TLDR:** I thought it was a good idea to buy more 3/19 17.5 calls. They are lotto tickets.  Tell me why I am stupid.

Gather round.

**Air rowdy with gains, the ground soiled with losses,** a cacophony of madness echoes around the WSB marketplace.  Creatures, more ape than human, stumble around arm-in-arm. Some singing stock war shanties, some angry, fighting... Many were bleeding from wounds suffered in recent campaigns of violence.  Many were drunk,  high off the scalped loot surrounded by sycophants and bimbos.. They were Pirates from another dimension.  The shrill voices of street callers rose above the din advertising campaigns of insanity and promising unending riches, adventure and steel. Hasty shrines to /u/deepfuckingvalue are erected in places surrounded by votive candles and incense burns. You like these shrines... it makes you feel like someone gave a fuck about something so much they were willing risk it all and let you in on their secrets.

In a forgotten corner, quite far away from the din is a statue of a man, so confident with his gaze that his iron skin glows green, sword sheathed yet ready, his other arm is outstretched offering the enchanting prize. The sword, the Tendie  The profound depth of the luminous spectacle draws you closer. He is at once intimidating, yet inviting.

You read the words inscribed on the plaque

The bazaar fades and there he is, standing before you on a mountainside, an eagle screams in the distance and he announces...

# I will teach you ""The Art of the Tendie""

**But first, go open a weekly chart... Do it.  It's important. Obviously GOEV's chart You Fool!....**

Also if you haven't looked... go look at the options ladder.. (I.E Google GOEV Options Ladder )

See this is a story of **Camelot** and the **Bear Cave** and **Bull Tzu**. Remember Friday, March 5 this stock was trash.  Worthless SPAC nonsense that was sliding towards the dumpster heap of irrelevant and overvalued ""good"" ideas like the rest of beer aisle past Yuengling.

This Friday, it will make you rich, if you let it.

**Look at the chart.  Really look at it. Bull Tzu was in control the entire fucking time.**

# But Brother Luminous the stock price went down!

**you Fool!, Bulls fight bears at the lowest price possible.**  Short Interest(Think of it as purchasing antishares) spent at lower levels that are immediately breached the next day is a huge loss. This ticker has been accumulating SI at lower and lower levels. **Bull Tzu** wants to fight shorts at the lowest possible share price and then gap open the next day.  Go look, I'm waiting. Monday Tuesday Wednesday.  It was this I noticed that there was intelligence behind the moves, not just horde hype.

# But Brother Luminous the SP can't go above 16... people keep selling...

**You Fool!...** well this is actually a reasonable interpretation, I get carried away but is still wrong in my opinion that this defines the price action completely. yes people sell, yes there is profit taking, yes there is swing traders but ***a consistency in the noise is what we call a signal***  Ill give you a second to let that sink in.

You can see the campaign of adventure right up into 15.   What I find hilarious is that it was at this time where the bear struck back hard.  It was done playing.  I wrote that the **Bull Tzu** caught the attack at the opening share price and then closed up.  This insulted and perhaps enraged the bear even further. This gives me a feel that Bull Tzu has a deep understanding of Tai Chi and uses his enemies aggression against them.  It was also the first time that the Bear attacked the Gamma Ramp Power Sword.  We see this behavior of trapped shorts in GME and RKT.

But here we are, **Camelot.** Big Titty Guinevere is looking at that war chest of 30k 15 dollar calls set to unlock come 1600 on Friday.   But what she doesn't know is that underneath the bed is 30k more calls at 17.5. And even more higher.

# The Bear den across the street from Camelot.

So for the past week we have been fighting between 15 and 16. Why is that? So 15 is **Camelot** and 16 is the **Bear Den**.  ITM 15 dollar calls generate MM bullish support as they continue to purchase shares based on the delta of the 15 dollar strike price.  As it approaches Friday that delta continues to approach 1 where MM must own 100 shares per call.

(Stock wizards will autisticaly howl with neck beards down to their panties that they can do other things but this is a broad over view obviously.)

I propose most shorts are in at a price from 17-18 based upon average age of the shorting and ""When would I short this pig"" feelings.  So a natural pain point would be when these 17.5 calls wake up and push the price past the break even points for the shorts. So every day **Bull Tzu** mounts a campaign into the Bear Den to find the pain point.  The bear wakes up at 1300 every day and attacks back.. but lately the attacks are weaker... Cup and handle morphology vs strait lines down, **Bull Tzu** dropped the share price recently to 15.11 and the bear got greedy, thought it could spill blood in Camelot... **Bull Tzu Laughs**. And used the enemies aggression against him.

# So What?

**Bull Tzu has been getting the bear to spend SI at lower and lower levels which shrinks the size of the bear cave due to lowering the average price at which they are short at. In** **~~2~~** **3 Days we have added almost** **~~2~~** **4 million shares short at these price levels.  Why the FUCK would you short this ticker now?!?! Oh, you're fucking trapped and running out of options that's why.**

**Even during the market tantrum today we were still bullish. Bull Tzu fucking dominates.**

# My theory is this.

A capable and tactical long erected a gamma ramp of psycho tier proportions.  It currently has 30k calls ITM at 15 with a delta of .8 and 30k 17.5 calls with a delta of .02. They are pushing trapped shorts into hopefully a Margin call and the way things are looking MM may get margin called at this point...

With that level of delta the 17.5 calls aren't priced in because the ticker has been trading sideways... Diminishing the IV

Clever girl.

# Let me repeat the 17.5 calls aren't fucking priced in.

Why does that matter?  Because that's 3 million fucking shares that the MM are going to buy when they are.   That's 45 million dollars that **Bull Tzu** doesn't have to spend. Do you see his greatness?  Do you see now his elegance...

Over the past week **Bull Tzu** has been getting the **Bear** to spend more and more SI.  SI is recorded at 100 percent utilized.. They are probably running low on ammo.  Fed Chair said Party on Garth.  Earnings announced 29th.  The Gamma Ramp Beckons.

**Why do you care?**

This could all be fantasy.  I could be off my meds Don Quixote. I could be making monsters out of shadows. This could not work out.  This could be the worst financial decision of my life but the more I look at it the more I'm convinced. **Bull Tzu** is real and he's on a fucking bear hunt.  **Bull Tzu** spent a lot of time, effort and energy putting this shit together so he can teach you **the art of the Tendie**. All you have to do is listen. Tony Aquila is a badass and played the last week perfectly. Read edition 7 of the bull case, the weekend edition, you might actually be convinced.  Also... What happens when 10 million of SI is spewed all over a ticker that normally has a total volume of 6 million.  Fucking money happens.

Also if you have ever talked to an oldschool CanooBro Long and were unable to immediately leave the conversation because you forgot how to fake a heart attack. You will come to understand that they will diamond hand the fuck out of their shares.  Like, sub 100 is a dip.  For real.  I am not lying.  They know it. Now you know it.

I am going to go on record and say. **17.5 weeklies are basically a lotto ticket for this reason**.  April could 20's make more sense if you hate the thrill of danger... Pussy..  Or even.. buy shares... **GigaTurboPussy Status Confirmed**.  If you have RobinBull or WeHood they sell your shit a bit early... Keep that in mind...

Either way, Friday is going to be violent as fuck.

If it is a bad idea, I'll still sleep at night, I've survived worse than your spite. I promise.  Its up for you to confirm what I am saying is real.

**But if this is real... well.. you guys know the deal.  Bananaland Valhalla.  Lets fucking GO**

I want the most capable ape of you to open up a fucking chart and prove me wrong. Do it.

>According to a report from Bloomberg government which analyzed the SEC data, $359 million of GME shares failed to deliver or be covered, suggesting that many of the shares had been borrowed more than once.

The new insight for me was in the Dennis Kelleher's reply to this statement:

>The current regulations only require broker-dealers to have a ***reasonable*** ground to believe the security can be borrowed, so that it can be delivered on the delivery date.

The current regulation is a joke, in other words. This kind of language would not be enforceable by the SEC, even if it had the will to do so. He continues:

>The publicly available information certainly indicates that there' s a very high likelihood of abusive short-selling by somebody... Somebody lends a security to somebody who lends it to somebody else, who lends it to somebody else... It's almost a house of cards.

And to protect yourself against that falling house of cards? If only there were a stock with a Beta of -2! The irony is that here is a sound rational basis to buy GME as a hedge against a falling market, which only increases the probability of that outcome!",1616068044.0

TLDR: While Cramer's stock picks are OK during regular markets, his stock picks are shockingly not actually that bad during a crazy bull run. In fact, after the pandemic, on average, he was able to beat the SPY and QQQ by around 50% to 100% with respect to the SPY and QQQ. This is actually quite good, especially for a man that picks around 2000 to 2500 stocks a year, with some repetition. However the main downside to his picks is the high degree of variance, meaning there are a wider range of outcomes, both good and bad, than with either the SPX or QQQ. If words like ‚Äústatistics‚Äù and ‚Äúmethodology‚Äù make your eyes glaze over or if you are illiterate, feel free to skip to part 3 with the graphs and pictures, but I would strongly advise everyone to actually read the introduction and methodology and not just take the short bus to part 3 as it will be helpful for understanding what the data actually means as well as how to interpret the data.

&#x200B;

Suggested reading: If you have no idea what the following concepts are, I would highly recommend you skim a Wikipedia page to get at least a dictionary.com level of comprehension as the following topics will be used throughout this analysis: probability density, Gaussian and multimodal distributions, standard deviation, regression to the mean, variance, expected value, basic probability, and the number line (This is WSB after all). There will be no hardcore math (besides maybe 2+3 = ??), but the concepts will be important.

  
Part 1: Introduction: 

  
Jim Cramer. The man, the myth, the meme. He is a perennial presence on CNBC and a favorite of the boomers. There are a wide range of opinions on the man, from shill to lunatic to conman. Before I started this project, I personally fell in to the ""Cramer is a lunatic with a button budget larger than North Korea's"" camp. But how good is he at picking stocks? Looking to the past, there are many articles that show that he is not great at picking stocks, but with the recent pandemic and the wide range of opinions, I wanted to take a statistical and data driven look at his performance of his recommended stocks from his show, Mad Money, to understand if he was underperforming, and if so, in what way. So to that end, I extracted the data from his [website](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm), wrote a few python scripts to analyze the data to generate probability density function approximations for 1, 3 and 6 month percent returns for his stock picks (n = \~5500), and then compared those picks to probability density function approximations from the same time period of the $SPY and $QQQ. Again, I have put those things up at the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shitilostagain/JimmyChill), so feel free to take a look at that.

As we go through this analysis, we need to keep in mind three things while looking at Cramer's performance. The first thing is who is generally in his audience, which is mostly consisted of ""casual investors"". These investors are not like us degenerates gambling with FDs and working behind a Wendy's all to blow it on companies we have never heard of, nor are they wealthy individuals with access to hedge funds. These casual investors from r/investing are more focused on reliable returns, so if Cramer can do as well as the SPX or the QQQ without too much risk, that is all that really matters, as that is his major competition. The second thing we need to keep in mind is that because Cramer is making so many picks, we need to realize that he really can't do too much better or worse on average than the indices, as his picks constitute a small but reasonable chunk of the indices, so there will be some level of correlation between the indices and his picks. The second point is effectively regression to the mean, which as a side note is part of why it is so hard to beat the market in the aggregate. Even if you pick a 10 bagger stock, the majority of them are not, so you will move closer to the average over time as you select more and more stocks. The third and final thing to keep in mind is that the sample size (n = ) will vary from sample set to sample set from 1145 on the low end to 3053 on the high end. While ideally this would be higher, it should be enough for this analysis to get a good idea of Cramer's performance relative to the SPY and QQQ. In the spirit of transparency, each sample size will be displayed below each chart. At least it is not as bad as a sample size of 30 (Looking at you, psychology).

  
Part 2: Methodology: 

  
In this methodology section I will not go into details about how I actually did the nuts and bolts of finding the stock data and performing the analysis, as if you are interested, the source code is on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shitilostagain/JimmyChill). What I will focus on is on how Jim Cramer compares to SPY and QQQ and how I chose what data to include and how to present it. Looking around at other analyses, what I see a lot of is comparison of basic statistics, and while that is interesting, it does not really give a good picture of whether Cramer's picks are good, bad, or risky. There also is not a lot of solid analysis of how those picks perform relative to another security, so to figure out if his picks are good or bad bets, we can do a little bit better than just comparing a few numbers. 	

Lets first talk about what we all deep down know about the stock market, and that it is that it is effectively gambling. At its core, when I buy a stock or options or whatever security for some amount of money, I am making a bet that it will increase an amount proportional to my appetite for risk. To that degree we can use economical, statistical, probabilistic, and psychological tools to understand the market. So for this analysis, to understand the risks and probability of making certain percentages of profit, we want to know the probability density map of percent returns if we were to randomly use one of Cramer's stock picks, as we want to know both the amount of risk, categorized by variance, as well as the possible outcomes from his plays as well as how likely they are. To categorize Cramer's performance, we will use a [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) applied to the relevant histograms to approximate a probability density function which will allow us to look at the variance (Risk) and probabilities associated with percent gains/losses over set intervals of time. We can then compare the probability density approximations of his picks to the probability density approximations of the SPY and QQQ to compare the differences. As discussed before, we will be comparing his picks to the SPY and QQQ as those represent the main competition to his picks for his audience, which consists mostly of casual investors. 	

Now lets talk about how we will compare his picks to the SPY and QQQ. At first glance, the easiest thing to do is just create a histogram of 1, 3, and 6 month increases and compare it to his picks. But there is a problem in doing that, and that is that in the stock market, there really is no such thing as an independent variable. The stock market is effectively an Nth order differential equation in M variables that is constantly being assaulted by random chance, and in a given market environment, stocks could run hotter, the market could have variable inflows of funds, sector rotations could be occurring, or there may be more variance in day to day movement based on whatever is happening in the market and the outside world, with accurate prediction of the market being near impossible. When Cramer recommends a stock, he is effectively saying that **at that moment, for the given market environment/period, he is making a bet that his pick will outperform the market or at least perform relatively well on average during that time period**. So to make sure our comparisons respect the statistical dependence between the variables, we will be looking at the price movement of the SPY and QQQ with respect to the date of each of the stock picks and be creating a histogram from that data to directly compare to Cramer's picks. We also have to acknowledge the severe difference in market conditions pre and post pandemic, so we will be looking at his performance relative to the SPY and QQQ during those different times separately. Note that for our purposes, I am defining the pandemic crash from 01/20/2020 to 03/20/2020, so pre pandemic will be defined from before this range and post pandemic will be defined from after this range.  
 

 Part 3: Pre-pandemic Performance relative to the SPY and QQQ:   


Ok, lets first look at the probability distributions. Higher res plots can be downloaded from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shitilostagain/JimmyChill). In case it is too hard to see the legend, the blue line is $SPY, the orange line is $QQQ, and the green line is Cramer's picks:  

[Probability density approximations \(KDE\) of 1 month returns, pre pandemic, Cramer vs. QQQ vs SPY, n = 3053](https://preview.redd.it/90i8yg41qnn61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd2148a31347a0ae2500718d91a219c6395dc8c)

[Probability density approximations \(KDE\) of 6 month returns, pre pandemic, Cramer vs. QQQ vs SPY, n = 2030 ](https://preview.redd.it/htowejj7qnn61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1cd374a8cf410b5b7850d63b7888f98e8a33a5f)

Now lets look at 1, 3 and 6 month averages: (Note: same n values & underlying data as above)

Average returns, 1 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 0.86% , QQQ = 1.09% , Cramer = 0.85%

Average returns, 3 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 1.50% , QQQ = 2.04% , Cramer = 0.56%

Average returns, 6 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 3.58% , QQQ = 4.93% , Cramer = 2.30%

&#x200B;

In looking at the data, we can see that Cramer performs around as well as the SPY and QQQ when we look at the averages. But there is one major downside to Cramer in looking at these plots, and that is the variance. With the SPY and QQQ, you get nice, steady, reliable returns with little risk of catastrophic loss, provided that there is no market crash. But if you take Cramer's advice, there is an enormous amount of variance that we can see, as the tails of Cramer's bell curve are much further out than the tails of the SPY and QQQ multimodal distributions. Also note that in Cramer's bell curve, the peak is lower and flatter than the ""peaks"" for the SPY and QQQ which does not help him with variance either, as a wider range of likely outcomes can occur within a given segment of Cramer's probability distribution versus the SPY and QQQ distributions.  With Cramer, you could get lucky and hit a 3+ standard deviation event and make 50%+ returns, but you are also just as likely to lose 50% or more. So for pre-pandemic performance, if you were looking for nice, steady returns, the SPY and QQQ appear to be a better pick for the casual investor over Cramer. 

  
Part 4: Post-pandemic Performance relative to the SPY and QQQ: 

  
 Again, lets first look at the probability distributions. Higher res plots can be downloaded from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shitilostagain/JimmyChill). In case it is too hard to see the legend, the blue line is $SPY, the orange line is $QQQ, and the green line is Cramer's picks:  

[Probability density approximations \(KDE\) of 1 month returns, post pandemic, Cramer vs. QQQ vs SPY, n = 2220](https://preview.redd.it/ekocoanaqnn61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a83b10fac38109ce4a5e538f1552ca20f07f933)

[Probability density approximations \(KDE\) of 3 month returns, post pandemic, Cramer vs. QQQ vs SPY, n = 1816](https://preview.redd.it/rpzwh6u9unn61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd7695dbe7ed752dfae803eab790f1d92b07c7c)

[Probability density approximations \(KDE\) of 6 month returns, post pandemic, Cramer vs. QQQ vs SPY, n = 1145](https://preview.redd.it/k1vmlgacunn61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d8579ad9d90956de75acde94d5cd43784ed6c95)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at 1, 3 and 6 month averages: (Note: same n values & underlying data as above)

Average returns, 1 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 4.21% , QQQ = 5.45% , Cramer = 6.12%

Average returns, 3 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 10.79% , QQQ = 15.15%, Cramer = 20.24%

Average returns, 6 month, pre-pandemic: SPY = 19.84% , QQQ = 27.80%, Cramer = 35.78%

&#x200B;

Looking at these plots, we can clearly see that Cramer's picks got a lot better overnight after the pandemic crash ended. While Cramer's picks still have an enormous amount of variance, the average returns are quite good, as they are much higher than the SPY and QQQ, and the max potential profit has gotten much larger to around 500% while the losses are still capped at 100%. While in the pre pandemic data Cramer's risk did not match the reward for the casual investor, for this post-pandemic data, I am torn. On one hand Cramer's plays can be dangerous for someone looking for reliable income, as the SPY and QQQ have performed well enough on their own and do not carry a lot of risk. But depending on you appetite for risk, Cramer's pandemic plays have performed quite well, and are probably better for certain investors who are looking to gamble a little bit.

Another thing to touch on is that I'm sure we are all familiar with the saying that everybody is a genius in a bull market (Looking at you, Cathie Woods), and from these plots that is crystal clear, as we are in a market environment where Jim Cramer can get 35% returns in 6 months. Looking at the SPY and QQQ distributions, they are clearly doing a lot better after the pandemic versus before, with the average returns being unusually high compared to historic returns. I haven't done the calculations, but it looks like if we take the integral (i.e. area under the curve) from 0 to ‚àû for the pre and post pandemic distributions for Cramer's picks, the post pandemic integrals look to be around .1 to .2 larger relative to the pre pandemic integrals (area of a probability density = 1). In layman's terms, this means that overall, more of Cramer's probability distribution has become profitable. The stark contrast between the pre and post pandemic plots is also a visual way to see why we have to separate the market out into different environments, as the overall performance of the market differs greatly over different conditions, so it is not necessarily statistical meaningful to compare even the same tickers to each other given different market conditions, so we have to be careful to select our ranges. If we were to average all the data for all market conditions, we would end up losing quite a bit of the signal and end up dulling the results.

  
    
Part 5: Conclusion: 

Wow. That was long. Hopefully you all learned something, because I sure did over the course of putting this together. One thing to understand is that even though Cramer actually fucking killed it after the pandemic relative to the SPY and QQQ, his hot streak will likely come to an end as the bull market tapers off, and his performance may likely end up reverting back to pre-pandemic levels. I still think Cramer is a lunatic with Kim Jong Un's button budget, but hey, his stock picks aren't half bad during a crazy bull run. Maybe in the future I will look at the performance of the ARKK ETFs or take a rigorous look at technical analysis as I think there might be some interesting data in there to investigate.",1616066564.0

Original post by u/DawgPound98

I‚Äôm so sick of short sellers like Citron and Hindenburg to the point where I‚Äôve decided to load up on shares and calls on Hindenburg‚Äôs latest target, Lordstown Motors.

If you haven‚Äôt heard of Hindenburg Research, they are a group of 5 dudes who work out of an apartment in NY. They take large short positions in companies and then release research reports to the public to slander them for their own financial gain.

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year ‚Äì which I think anyone could have called out. Nikola had no factory or means of production for several years.. pretty easy to expose them especially once their stock ran up to $80/share.

**Hindenburg Attacks Lordstown With Multiple Inaccurate Claims**

Last Friday, Hindenburg went after Lordstown Motors saying they have no ‚Äúsellable product‚Äù and that they are ‚Äú3-4 years away‚Äù from production (according to ‚Äúformer employees‚Äù)

Well ‚Äì Lordstown had an investor call earlier today confirming that production is beginning THIS September (in 6 months), and they also provided [video evidence](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20) that they are currently in the beta phase (think of beta as essentially 97% of the finalized vehicle).

Additionally, Texas-based E-Squared Energy CEO [came to the defense of Lordstown](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/) after the short report explaining that they intend to fill all 14,000 orders over a 2-3 year period. Lordstown is targeting fleet customers initially, so they will be selling a lot of vehicles to service partners like E-Squared Energy (who then sell to actual fleets).

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg was right about Nikola.. Aren‚Äôt they probably right about Lordstown too?**

Nope. I live in Ohio near the enormous Lordstown facility, and that parking lot has been packed every day with workers for about 2 years now. I also know first-hand what this company means to the state of Ohio. Lordstown is in the final due diligence phase for the [Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (‚ÄúATVM‚Äù) loan opportunity](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) ‚Äì which is a very big deal for any company, especially a start-up. They have over 500 employees and over 200 consultants working there currently. The number of workers will be double by production in September.

Lordstown‚Äôs flagship *Endurance* truck will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) next month in one of the toughest races ever designed, the San Felipe 250. You can also see numerous other videos of their truck via their YouTube channel.

&#x200B;

**Brief history on Lordstown Motors:**

Lordstown Motors acquired a [6.2 million square foot facility back in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) ‚Äì this facility now has a replacement value of \~ $3 billion, but they received it for pennies on the dollar due to [GM‚Äôs desire to invest](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) in Lordstown. Within their massive production facility, they have carved out an [800,000 square foot area for their propulsion facility](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-prepares-ohio-factory-to-begin-building-betas-next-month) ‚Äì which will house production lines for advanced battery packs and hub motors.

Lordstown‚Äôs CEO, Steve Burns, is an entrepreneur who has always been ahead of his time. Over 15 years ago, he created a startup called MobileVoiceControl‚Äîa predecessor to Siri. The technology patents that Burns developed were then sold and [used to help Apple create Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

&#x200B;

**Summary of Lordstown‚Äôs investor call from 4:30pm EST today:**

1. It was confirmed that production will begin this September ‚Äì which will make the *Endurance* the first ever *full-size* electric pick-up truck to hit the road. This will allow them first-mover advantage into the massive light duty truck market.

2. The development mule that caught fire a few months ago was a result of human error ‚Äì this was a human-made prototype, and the Betas that are currently being produced are being welded by robots (Betas are basically 97% of the actual finished product ‚Äì so these will be a much more accurate depiction of the final vehicle than the development mules were several months ago).

3. In the coming weeks, as betas come off the production line, the vehicles will be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.

4. The fleet vehicle market is unique ‚Äì which is why pre-order numbers are more based on calculated estimates from service partners like E-Squared Energy (mentioned earlier) and [Holman Enterprises](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-holman-enterprises-announce-co-marketing). Holman manages 2 million vehicles including 600K pick-ups. These service partners buy from Lordstown and then sell directly to fleets. It‚Äôs important to build relationships early-on with these service partners especially since Lordstown is going to be first-to-market in 6 months.

5. Demand remains very strong amongst service partners, government agencies, and commercial fleets. 

&#x200B;

**This is all great, but how in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the whole country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow Lordstown to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays via Camping World‚Äôs footprint.

Marcus Lemonis is the CEO of Camping World and a successful businessman and entrepreneur featured on ‚ÄúThe Profit.‚Äù This man would not enter a long-term strategic partnership with a company unless it was the **real deal**, and I can tell you with 100% confidence that he‚Äôs been [all-in on Lordstown](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?lang=en) since last year. I highly recommend visiting Marcus‚Äô twitter and looking through all of the videos and tweets pertaining to Lordstown.

[Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) is on board too!

&#x200B;

**Anything else besides their Endurance truck?**

They announced today that they will do a demonstration of their [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) this summer, and it will begin production next year. Their 3rd vehicle will likely be a large SUV.

Keep in mind that as of 2021, the [global light duty vehicles market size is valued at over $600 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market) ‚Äì creating a lot of space for companies like Lordstown to come in and disrupt the industry with their advanced technology and a low price point ($45,000 after federal tax credit).

But given all of that, I think $RIDE‚Äôs current *market cap* is currently wayyyy too low especially relative to others in the EV industry. 

&#x200B;

**What is a market cap?**

Market cap‚Äîor market capitalization‚Äîrefers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. 

Market cap allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. It effectively measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects.

&#x200B;

**Why are you talking about market cap?**

Because I think it is important to look at Lordstown‚Äôs market cap in comparison with two of the other most popular start-up EV truck companies based in the US. *These numbers were from 3pm EST earlier today*:

*Nikola $NKLA - $5.9 billion market cap*

*Canoo $GOEV - $3.9 billion market cap*

**What is Lordstown‚Äôs market cap?**

*Lordstown $RIDE - $2.3 billion market cap*

Listen.. I‚Äôm just making the point that Lordstown has one of the **biggest factories** in the country and also will be able to produce [**600,000 vehicles annually**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) in a couple of years‚Äô time. 

Lordstown is only 6 months away from **mass producing** (not hand-making) the world‚Äôs first ever *full size* electric pick-up truck. An *Endurance* will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes in September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the stock is accurately-priced especially relative to its peers.

Companies like Nikola, Canoo, and many other EV start-ups are year(s) away from mass production. And I can‚Äôt even imagine the 10‚Äôs of billions of dollars it will cost those companies to get to market ‚Äì meanwhile, Lordstown acquired their state-of-the-art facility for [$40 million](https://www.mbtmag.com/home/news/21244850/lordstown-motors-to-finish-first-electric-truck-prototypes-in-march) (and then a couple hundred million in re-tooling the facility). But seriously ‚Äì this is basically pennies compared to what other EV players like Rivian are paying for their production facilities.

&#x200B;

**Is this just a pump and dump DD post?**

Nope ‚Äì I‚Äôm actually holding mostly January 2023 calls (LEAPS) - meaning that I believe in the long-term growth story here. I have 10 January 2023 call contracts at a $40 strike price. My price target for January 2023 is $150/share, which would mean a market cap of \~ $20 billion. This is a very volatile stock if you look at the 6-month chart, which is why I think holding onto shares or LEAPS is the smartest approach. It is also worth noting that the average price target between the 5 analysts that cover the stock is $30.

Additionally, I hate Hindenburg, and seeing that ‚Äúreport‚Äù last Friday set me off. That‚Äôs what caused me to do so much research into Lordstown over the past week.

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

To quote Warren Buffett, ‚ÄúYou should be greedy when others are fearful‚Äù

Hindenburg Research putting out a hit-piece against $RIDE has created some fear for investors. This fear has caused a sell-off and an increasingly high short interest in the stock ‚Äì I think Hindenburg and the remaining shorts are going to have to cover by the end of this week before they get burned really badly. This company is very real and it is now in the public-eye more than it has ever been.

And to the doubters and bears that will appear in the comments - you‚Äôre going to come back and look at this post in about a year when $RIDE is valued about 3-4x of its current price and wish you would have loaded up on these cheap shares ;)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Citron and Hindenburg can go straight to hell. Load the boat on shares of $RIDE ‚Äì this chart is poised for a breakout. Read my whole post if you want to see why Lordstown is legit and Hindenburg isn‚Äôt.

This week has been a doozy as the overall stock market waited anxiously for the FOMC meeting. What was once a cloud of uncertainty, is now‚Ä¶.a cloud of uncertainty.

I‚Äôd like to give an overall update on what happened today, and to my FOMC Playbook, that was posted earlier on Sunday night. I'll probably make this a recurring thing, but probably only leading up to big events, as this is draining and I tend to not be able to get much work done due to research. Luckily, this one didn't include much research. The first Playbook post still has a lot to do with where we still stand, so if you're looking for an in-depth and specifics post, go read that instead.

I‚Äôve been getting flooded with messages with questions and thanking me for the playbook and all the DD on the last one, begging me to make this a continuing thing. I appreciate all the love I've gotten, and I'm happy to see so many of you eager to learn more about the technical/mathematics side of the stock market, and what the stock market truly is. I tried posting an update yesterday, but it was removed due to not getting enough karma in the required time. Probably because I kept editing typos which briefly takes it down. Since it's been a bit overwhelming with the private messages, I decided to just give on big update. If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, I‚Äôll put the link down below.


[FOMC Playbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m568xl/simplified_fomc_playbook_for_smooth_brains/?ref=share&ref_source=link)


**And as always, there's a TLDR at the bottom, because these things tend to be quite long**


# **What‚Äôs changed, what‚Äôs the same, and what is still uncertain:**


## **Changed:**


### **The Dot Plot:**

Probably the juiciest part of this underwhelming FOMC meeting, was the dot plot. The dot plot has changed a bit. The dot plot is a graph of financial professionals‚Äô estimations on when we should expect to see higher Fed rates. In terms of the rate hikes, a projection of rate hikes in 2022 rose to 4 member projections, as opposed to just one last month. For 2023, the number of members increased to 7, as opposed to last month which was 5.


### **GDP and Unemployment:**


Expectations of a booming economy increased dramatically, with the GDP projections growing to 6.5%, up from December‚Äôs meeting, which was 4.2%.

That might be due to inflation, but it could also very well be because of the optimistic vaccination statements from Biden. Or a combination of both. Who knows, let‚Äôs let this economy run hot, as long as it doesn‚Äôt become so hot it melts.

Obviously a better economic outlook usually includes better unemployment rates. This one is a no brainer, they‚Äôve expected unemployment to be 4.5%, which is a .5% difference from the previous estimate of 5%.



### **Inflation:**


This could potentially be in both the Changed or Unchanged category, but I‚Äôll put it here because the Unchanged section is a bit long. J Pow announced that they‚Äôre till consistent with their goal of 2% inflation. He stated that this really depends on the course of the virus and the economy. What‚Äôs changed is that he was a bit more anxious this time around, and discussed that inflation might actually run moderately above 2% during this year. He did however, calm the public by assuring them that it will be brief and will go back down fairly quickly. I mean yeah, we all know the CPI is bullshit, and inflation is hidden in assets rather than consumer prices these days, but nobody is going to give you a gold star or a nobel prize for knowing that. What matters is what they tell us, and how you play it. So keep your ‚ÄúweLL acKTuAlly‚Äù comments to a minimum. Last meeting, the Fed saw 1.8% inflation for this year, but this meeting, they increased it to 2.4%. We get another .6% increase at the April FOMC, we‚Äôre in for a ride.


However, they also hiked up inflation for 2022 and 2023.



### **Moratorium and Consumer Debt:**


*This one doesn‚Äôt really have much to do with FOMC, but the stimulus was passed without a moratorium extension, so I thought I would include it. The moratorium was put in place for rent/mortgage forbearance. Evictions were banned, but the rent they weren‚Äôt paying still built up. March 31st, this all comes into play, which coincidentally aligns with the SLR suspension potentially ending that day. I go more in depth on SLR later on, but these two things could be somewhat correlated. The Federal Reserve has gone in depth about how consumer debt is at an all-time low, but it‚Äôs easy to make the connection of the combination of rent/mortgage/credit card forbearance, plus stimmys. If SLR suspension is extended in combination of the moratorium ending, there could be a pretty big shit storm. You‚Äôll see why later on in this post.



## **What‚Äôs The Same:**


### **No Rate Hike Through 2023:**


Most of you gambling addicts probably came in your pants around 2:00 PM EST today, when the FOMC statement was released on the Federal Reserve website. You saw those beautiful words on the statement, announcing their rate hikes haven‚Äôt changed. Or maybe you don‚Äôt know how to read and you‚Äôre more of a picture guy, and you watched the Nasdaq have a green Johnny Sins boner upwards. No matter which person you are, you probably had to change your pants, because they were a bit too sticky inside for your liking. No rate hikes means uppies for technology stocks. Not as much as it would be if they implemented Yield Curve Control and extended the SLR suspension, but uppies none the less. You‚Äôve unlocked the forbidden knowledge of the rich, and how inflation is the most powerful tool for your assets. Congrats, you can now afford to supersize that meal at McDonald‚Äôs and impress the date you brought with you. We‚Äôve survived the March 2021 FOMC, and we can relax and breathe until the next meeting, which is April 27-28.


### **Bond Buying:**


J Pow has confirmed his commitment to continuing to buy bonds at the pace of $120b per month. This includes around $80b a month in treasuries, as well as $40b a month in mortgage-backed securities. There was a veil of uncertainty leading up to this week revolving around treasury purchases. We didn‚Äôt know whether or not they were going to implement Yield Curve Control, or if they were going to ease off the bond buying. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Yield Curve Control, it‚Äôs basically what they‚Äôre doing with bond buying at the moment, except instead of a $120b goal/ceiling, it‚Äôs more of a blank check. Meaning they‚Äôll fire up the money printer to crater those despised treasury yields that you all have come to know and love recently.


I had a feeling going into this with the forecast of YCC being off the table. Inflation is off the charts, but not the way that the Federal Reserve presents it. The Federal Reserve knows how dramatic inflation is increasing, and there‚Äôs a chance YCC could have devastating impacts on the United States, as well as globally. There are rumors that the U.S. dollar could never become devastatingly inflated, due to the fact that it‚Äôs the tried-and-true international currency. In the eyes of the growing global economy, the U.S. Dollar is king. When they look at Benjamin Franklin, and they stare deeply into those big eyes of his, they see an optimistic economic future. Let‚Äôs pump the brakes. Yes, it‚Äôs very unlikely that the dollar would ever become that inflated, as we would stop it immediately. But impossible? No. Luckily for us and the rest of the globe, in terms of my FOMC playbook, severe inflation of the dollar is the least appetizing end game scenario of this year. An extremely inflated dollar would mean the rest of the world would have to keep up by also inflating their currency. Eventually, causing global economic fallout, ending all modern-day forms of currency in every first world country. Which is why I believe YCC will be off the table for quite a bit of time. At least until we deflate.


### **Letting It Run Hot:**


Of course, we‚Äôre in quite a pickle. Yields are rising, which translates into investors believing inflation will accelerate. Opening up the economy will be giving inflation an 8-ball of yayo, a fifth of Maker‚Äôs Mark, and the keys to the Tesla Roadster, which just so happens to have a 0-60 time of 2.1 seconds. But now would not be the time to make any inflation suppressing moves, as I forgot to mention in the previous sentence, that roadster is doing its best to outrun the black hole of COVID. Any inflationary suppression tactics during the reopening of the economy, would send us further back economically than spring of 2020 ever could dream of. Thus, we should let inflation put the pedal to the metal, but make sure it doesn‚Äôt wrap around a tree. Unfortunately, I agree that this is the best plan of action. For now.



## **What‚Äôs Still Uncertain:**


### **The Star of The Show (Supplementary Leverage Ratio):**


All eyes were on J Pow‚Äôs announcement today of whether or not they will extend the SLR suspension, or end it all together. The suspension extension, first put in place when the market crashed in March 2020, is set to end March 31st of this year. Leaving us with exactly 14 days left, every big bank, treasury yield, and speculative stock price, are left sitting on the edge of their seat once again. This is the determining factor of whether or not the Nasdaq can make a comeback, or crater into the abyss. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) was put into place in 2010, following the housing market crash of 2008. This was done to protect the average joe from being grossly taken advantage of by Wall Street. Also known as Basel III, this implementation requires a certain amount of liquid capital for banks, in order to prevent a run on banks, in the event of a market crash. During the crisis of 2008, the American people panicked, and went to withdraw their money from banks and liquidate their assets, such as stocks and other investments. The lack of liquidity left them with a liquidity crisis, and people were not able to withdraw their life savings, as the bank didn‚Äôt actually have the money to pay them out (ex: Bear Stearns). Without SLR, ordinary people lost their jobs, their life savings, their homes, or all three.


Although we don't know for sure, there have been a lot of interviews this week with C-Level employees at big banks leading up to FOMC. It seems like the general consensus is, yields will continue to rise. I think that this is a hint that SLR suspension won't be extended. J Pow might be waiting to tell us, so that we can digest today's FOMC before dropping the SLR bomb on us. He's probably realized by now that we tend to overreact. My reasoning behind this is the fact that there‚Äôs a revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC/Federal Reserve. The big banks have contacts at both the SEC and the Federal Reserve, who fill them in on information regarding policy changes. Usually, it‚Äôs someone who left that bank and went to a high level position at the SEC or Federal Reserve. Big banks openly discuss to the public big bonus opportunities if an employee were to leave for a job with the federal government. These bonuses have been disclosed to be in the millions. Meaning, the big banks hinting that yields will continue to rise, might indicate that one of their contacts informed them that the SLR suspension will not be extended.


**So, what the fuck do I care? How does this affect the stock market?**


When the SLR was suspended, big banks bought up trillions of dollars worth of treasuries. This was done in order for people to invest in the stock market, rather than a long-term fixed rate security. Investing in the stock market allows for corporations to have increased equity, allowing them to keep the lay-offs to a minimum, prevent them from closing their doors, and to drive innovation and business throughout the COVID crisis. Thus, leading to the NASDAQ rising 90% in under a year. Extending the SLR suspension and reimplementing SLR both have some big potential consequences. Extending the SLR suspension means that, if we God-forbid have another black swan event, or if the reopening of the economy isn‚Äôt quite to the public‚Äôs expectations, a crash can occur. If a crash happens while the SLR is suspended, we have a Bear Stearns repeat, and more than likely, a Bear Stearns repeat on steroids. If SLR is reimplemented, following March 31st, the big banks have full legal ability to unload those trillions of dollars in treasuries, causing a dramatic squeeze upwards in yields. Due to the fact that treasury yields tend to represent levels of inflation in the public‚Äôs eye, people would more than likely sell off their treasuries, as it would make no sense to have a fixed rate of return of ~1.5% if the census is that inflation has risen dramatically (As you would technically be losing money keeping it in treasuries). Fear of inflation becomes fear of increased Fed rates, leading to a sell off of stocks in the technology sector, as well as anything speculative. Simply put, a dramatic yield squeeze upwards would pop all bubbles. This was mentioned in my original playbook post, as this would pop the Nasdaq bubble, potentially bringing the rest of the market down with it (Although the rest of the market wasn‚Äôt too devasted after the Dot Com Bubble). Mortgage rates go off of the 10-year and 30-year yields, which would pop the housing bubble. The pop of the housing and stock bubble would lead to the popping of the debt bubble. Popping the mortgage and stock bubble would lead to a pop in the commodity bubble, etc. This is inevitable, but preferably, we push it to later in the year. Let‚Äôs say, September for now. 

*If people lost their assets and life savings, they would likely be more cautious about spending money, which is not good with the economy is reopening*


### **The Debt Ceiling:**


Back in 2019, the federal debt ceiling was suspended, giving the Federal Reserve full control over how the country‚Äôs financial system is managed. We need more money? No problem, lemme just print out tens of trillions of dollars and hand it out, as we don‚Äôt have a debt budget to stay underneath, and we don‚Äôt need Congress approval.


Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately (depends on who you are), there are some politicians who want to completely remove the country‚Äôs debt ceiling permanently. It was included in the original third COVID stimulus bill, which is one of the main reasons why the first time around it was rejected and had to be changed. After this rejection, they went to try and get it passed through budget reconciliation, which was also rejected. This debt ceiling suspension ends at the end of July this year, which could lead to some‚Ä¶. Problems. They‚Äôve pushed back any discussion of it until July, in an attempt to cause some hysteria in Capitol Hill due to it becoming a last minute crisis. They might successfully fully get rid of it, or they might raise the debt ceiling to $50T or $100T, so that we don‚Äôt have to worry about a debt ceiling for the foreseeable future. There are two other options at play here, one is, it‚Äôll reset automatically to whatever the country‚Äôs debt is at the time of expiry if they can't come to a vote, and two, it becomes unsuspended without any raising of the ceiling, requiring us to be at the debt level we were at in the Summer of 2019. Yeah, ouch. If we don‚Äôt, we default on our debts, and China, who we owe the most debt to, starts rubbing their hands, fantasizing about what their price is to pay them back for the trillions we owe them ( [Chinese Debt Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy) ). Highly unlikely we reverse the debt ceiling to what it was in 2019. My guess is, we slightly raise it, or we remove/dramatically raise it if the Dems can remove the filibuster. But even then, I highly doubt some moderate Democrats will vote for that. But if they do, congrats, stocks go up forever, and we‚Äôll never seen a correction ever again.

## *Potential Outcomes: stonks go up forever, stonks go down, and stonks go down but we also pledge allegiance to Xi Jinping.*



# **How To Play This:**


*Good God, I feel like Vlad Tenev.*


Yeah, yeah, none of that shit above matters, what matters is tendies.


Well, I was supposed to have an absolute answer for all of you today, as we were supposed to be able to narrow the 4 scenarios from the playbook down to 1. Well, since J Pow wants to keep SLR a secret, we can at least narrow it down to two. 



## **SLR Suspension Extended:**


Yields may continue to rise, but not as dramatic and doomsday if it wasn‚Äôt extended. NAHB came out today and publicly announced that the home building industry is quite devastated. Due to the rise in mortgage rates from the treasury yields, the 350%+ inflated price of lumber, and the shortage of lumber in general, the home builders market is going to tank most likely. My previous post included $ITB puts, as it tracks the home builders ETF. However, it tracks the real estate market off the Dow Jones, which is set to climb due to the uncertainty of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 (due to the Nasdaq). We saw today that the Dow Jones boosted ITB upwards, so I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre going to play it, be careful. Or at least wait until J Pow announces in the coming days the status of the SLR.


I think the safe bet here would be calls on commodity ETFs. They‚Äôll continue to rise due to inflation of the money printing, as well as the reopening of the economy. This means calls on CPER, PDBC, GSG. I recommend PDBC as it‚Äôs a broad ETF encompassing a lot of different commodities.



## **SLR Suspension Not Extended:**


The 98 story high rise is on fire, and the only quick and safe way to the ground is an elevator that fits 20 people. And there's only one elevator in the building.


If you don't catch my drift, there becomes a major yield squeeze upwards due to a major sell off of U.S. treasuries. The Nasdaq will be taking the largest hit, as they're the most sensitive to yields rising.


TLT puts (IV was in the single digits last week gah damn), QQQ puts, EV puts, you get the picture. There‚Äôs a chance that the Nasdaq can go down without bringing the whole market with it, and if that‚Äôs the case, do calls on big banks and stocks that are staples and essential (if you don‚Äôt know what that means, think what stocks boomers love, and then buy calls on those). If you do treasury puts, make sure you make the expiry a few weeks out, because SLR suspension won‚Äôt expire until March 31st.



## **And Of Course, A Meme Stonk Update:**


Not much to say here that I haven‚Äôt said all week and last week to people. I told them to not buy in until Wednesday near close or early Thursday. The gammas, the deltas, and the IV on all of the options were horrific. For smooth brains, bad gamma means the options you‚Äôre buying will be severely manipulated by wall street and hedge funds.


*Yes, it tells you the amount of manipulation you should expect to receive every time you buy options.*


I projected that it would trend downwards Monday thru Wednesday, and if it was going to pop upwards, it would be on Thursday or Friday. Be careful if you have options expiring this Friday, as most brokers automatically exercise your options if they‚Äôre $.01 or more in the money around noon, which will result in a 99%+ loss. And you‚Äôll probably screech at your computer, because it will probably go to the moon directly after yours gets auto exercised. Whatever you‚Äôre making your options expiry for, a good rule is to double it. Because shit happens.



## **Macroeconomics Standpoint and The Master Plan**



If you read the original playbook, you‚Äôd know the Federal Reserve is cornered into two options. 



**Letting the bubbles crash and burn** *(bad in the short term, great in the long term)*

Or

**Dangerous inflation** *(great for the short, horrendous in the long term)*


From what I‚Äôve gathered today, they‚Äôre still on the edge. But luckily, they might make me (a financials nerd/hawk) happy by having something finally click in their heads. Inflation, like I said earlier, is a very powerful tool for wealth creation. Which is why [Wall Street and others want the economy to run hot](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/investing/wall-street-markets-bill-dudley/index.html), and for inflation to keep flying. Money being made (strictly speaking numerically) accelerates upwards under inflation. If you‚Äôre smart about your debts and don‚Äôt tack on more (because debt can accelerate upwards faster too), debt becomes easier to pay off. More money + same amount of debt = easier to pay off. The Federal Reserve is the same way, except they tacked on more debt at the same time, and that‚Äôs why the debt clock accelerated at astronomical levels. 


I‚Äôm hoping that J Pow lets inflation keep going upwards, while stopping the Federal Reserve's spending, thus, being able to pay off a lot of the United States debt. J Pow is a smart man, and now there‚Äôs no more stimulus checks. Now he can just use the money printer to pay off the government's debt. I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs playing 4D chess with the debt we owe China and others. And not bending us over more. I'm only so flexible.


Either way, I expect there to be a rug pull around late summer/early fall. Potentially quad witching in September of this year, but we will see. Obviously, it's something we play by ear, and I'll be keeping tabs until then. I think we can run more, so when the time comes around where it's looking like the end of the road, don't call me a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª, I'm just a realist. I've only called a crash once, and that was back at the end of December 2019, because I had a feeling COVID was going to escape Wuhan. AKA I'm not someone who has predicted 14 of the last 3 crashes.



# **TLDR;**


4 scenario playbook cut down to 2 possibilities left.



**SLR suspension extended(40% likelihood):**  


Commodity calls (PDBC, CPER), commercial real estate calls (VNQ), or risky, but rewarding TLT calls, but probably short term, as it‚Äôll more than likely go up, and then come back down



**SLR suspension not extended (60% likelihood):** 


$TLT puts with April expiry. $QQQ puts. Technology/treasury puts all around. Residential real estate puts (mortgage rates move with yields, people don‚Äôt buy mortgages with a 7% mortgage rate).



**If you find some with single digit IV like I did at the end of last week, you can use them to hedge. I made three positions for this week. 2 were betting on yields rising, 1 was betting on yields falling. The IV was cheap enough to make profits this week either way.**

**EDIT: I‚Äôve made a mistake on one of these posts, i can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs this one or the original one. But when it comes to dividend risk, you don‚Äôt actually pay out the costs of dividends. The dividend risk means that when/after the ex-dividend date, the price of a stock can drop, because dividends are paid out of the stocks market cap. Which is good for puts and bad for calls, that‚Äôs why if your options expiry includes an ex dividend date during it, the calls are cheaper than usual, and the puts are more expensive.**


Hope this helps! Happy Hump Day!",1616065404.0
546,PSA: Its really easy to do taxes yourself even if your 1099 is 100+ pages,454,m7hi8y,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7hi8y/psa_its_really_easy_to_do_taxes_yourself_even_if/,95,"\[I originally posted this on r/options and a lot of people found useful, so posting here.  Did my best to make translation edits to your native ape language.  And also expanded to address some comments on my original post.\]   

 I'm pretty sure the majority of people who post ""can't wait to see the look on my accountants face when I drop 100 pages of transactions"" are just saying it as a joke. But for the noobs who actually think you need an accountant to do your taxes now that you're a big time trader...

**It takes 10 minutes to do yourself. Use TurboTax Premier. Your broker will give you a 1099 consolidated statement, which has the 1099-B. You just input the Total of all transactions.** Do not input each individual transaction unless you're trying to kill time because your wife locked in you the cuck closet while she gets railed by her boyfriend.

**The 1099-B will also have Wash Sales totals** and you just enter that and code ""W"".  Always input as positive numbers into Turbotax, even things that intuitively might feel like negatives.   

A common recommendation is that TurboTax will let you sync with your brokerage so just do an auto-upload of all transactions.   **Sure, go ahead and do auto-upload for 1099-DIV** for those times you went all Boomer on us and held T, IBM, and KO; **but I wouldn't do that for 1099-B.**  The reason is some of us print and review our taxes before filing since we have stuff like mortgage interest, charity, and other deductions.  You might be doing that yourself for your van down by the river and your donations to King Kong.   And if you auto-uploaded all your transactions when you print, you're going to have 50 pages of Form 8949 (Cap Gains). 

Here's where to find the totals by brokerages I have used:

* IBKR (Interactive Brokers) -summary 1099-B table on page 2, literally takes up just 1/4 of the page. This is my true degenerate account - and I have 40 pages of transactions behind it.
* Schwab - ok, Schwab sucks. It doesn't have a summary 1099-B table so you have to search through the doc, and they seem to list the same totals in a couple sections making it more confusing.  So that might add 2 minutes. Plus, just their layout sucks, so it's a much bigger document.  I probably have 10x the number of transactions in IBKR (degenerate account) vs Schwab (investment and theta gang account)  yet IBKR was 40pages while Schwab was 100+ pages.  For me, I finally it on page 96 of 112.      
* Vanguard - Summary table page 1.
* Robinhood - just kidding; I'm not 15 years old, so I use real brokerages.

Source: me using TurboTax Premier for the last 10+ years.  I used H&R Block before that, which sucks in comparison to TT.

P.S. Even though WSB is now flooded by too many banana eating noobs, I still follow this board sometimes and wish you all degenerates the best. May GAMCE bring you all the tendies!",1616064987.0
547,2-4 Yr Play: Molson Coors (TAP),18,m7he68,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7he68/24_yr_play_molson_coors_tap/,20," Current Price $48.66

52 Week high of $55

TAP- Last 5 years have been a bloodbath due to the lack of a seltzer. Don't believe me? Look at Boston Beer (SAM) and read their recent transcript about there Truly Seltzer and Twisted Tea driving success. Okay, so what, what is TAP doing? Deal in Fall 2020 with Coca Cola to distribute the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Deal with The Rock for his energy drink (guy is an ad himself, check his instagram), Deal with \[INSERT cannabis company because my original post got taken down\] to produce and distribute Cannabis Beverages (already being sold) under the name Truss Beverages, and have gotten into Coffee as well. All of this in the last year...

No longer a brewery, more of a beverage company. If you also believe inflation (or don't, but) the price of consumer goods will increase, and it may look like TAP garnered more revenue. TAP is also a reopening play as bars and restaurants open, more Molson Coors product will be sold. Coors is also making a Vizzy Seltzer and Coors Seltzer so the seltzer issue is solved between the three (incl Topo Chico). Final note: Scion Capital (Dr. Michael Burry) recently purchased TAP shares in Q4 2020 as reported on their filing on Feb 16th. I think it is important to always keep tabs on what ""smart money"" is doing.

548,What was the footprint of institutional trading in GME? Q from my written testimony,8235,m7h6uv,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/,766,"Hi all üëãüèª. Alexis Goldstein here. During my testimony before the House Financial Services Committee today, I tried to flag some open questions I have. One of them is, what was the volume of trading in GME (and other meme stocks) by institutional players who, unlike retail, can trade ‚Äúover the counter‚Äù (OTC) options (which they typically still hedge with listed stock). If regulators or Congress had a sense of the volumes of OTC options on GME that traded in periods of high volatility, that would give some insight into their overall footprint in the volatility.

550,$UWMC Gamma squeeze DD part deux,501,m7ghcq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ghcq/uwmc_gamma_squeeze_dd_part_deux/,131,"Not financial advice. I'm long 160 shares and 4/21 $9 call.

TLDR; assymetric risk profile on a long position in UWMC because of potential for gamma squeeze and  seemingly low probability of a whale taking a large short position via puts.

Part 1 here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6uhww/uwmc\_gamma\_squeeze\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6uhww/uwmc_gamma_squeeze_dd/)

Original idea came from: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6id0b/how\_uwmc\_can\_make\_us\_all\_rich\_friday\_do\_not\_waste/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6id0b/how_uwmc_can_make_us_all_rich_friday_do_not_waste/) \-- they have links to earlier posts there as well

UWMC closed above 9, which is positive for the gamma squeeze narrative. There was a short 3-minute spike at open, followed by a medium-volume sell-off for the next \~12 minutes. At 10:48AM PST, it started testing $9 levels and at 11AM began selling off slightly, which is the same time SPY went vertical because of something about a Fed meeting and JPOW saying brrrrrt. Probly bots. Anyways it closed above $9 and is at $9.36AH as I type this.

Volume as 10M today. Float is 90M

Things that might make it go up more:

* More buying than selling
* At or above $10 there seems to be a reasonable probability of the gamma squeeze happening. Look at OI at and above 10 for the next 3 expiry dates.
* Inclusion into the Russel index. Apparently for some reason that involves ETF mechanisms it could cause upwards pressure on the stock

Key Risks:

* More selling than buying
* Some asshat whale buying a metric fuck ton of puts thereby increasing MM net delta resulting in shares held to hedge short calls to be sold
   * This is a risky play though. No sell side analysts have a sell rating on the stock, and it's trading at around it's opening tick range post merger. Unlike in case of our holy GME, where prevailing sentiment is of a fundamentally overvalued stock (not saying it is, just stating sentiment). We saw a reverse gamma squeeze last Wed when a whale bought $4M worth of puts near peak price of $348 (conjecture):
      * MM forced to sell stock to get delta neutral
      * This moved the stock down enough to trigger stocks, bot wars and pure panic causing 7 stops on the way down before it settled in the low 200's.
   * Because of the fact that UWMC is not perceived by the street as grossly over valued, it would be incredibly risky to buy  a metric fuck ton of OTM puts
   * Same applies for a short equity position at these price levels. IMO it's not an attractive enough target.

For these reasons, I am claiming a long position in UWMC has an asymmetric risk profile on the upside.

If it dips at open tomorrow, I'm buying and if it goes up I'll also be buying. Staying away from the 1DTE calls though. I've lost enough money by being greedy and not putting stops in my GME options positions that I don't have the capital to comfortably YOLO 1DTE calls.

&#x200B;

Edit: positions (small but I got rekt by not having stops on my gme options plays last wed)

556,Who will win Autonomous Driving? Waymo Vs Tesla,129,m7f59g,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7f59g/who_will_win_autonomous_driving_waymo_vs_tesla/,125,"After watching a video featuring Teslas ""Full self driving"" video Vs a Waymo video I have realized Waymo is far ahead of Tesla. Comparing the dashboard display of what the car is seeing, Waymo's software is far more advanced, less erratic and to me seems evident that Elon will indeed need a Lidar/Camera sensor like Microvisions which will be released in April . IMO Teslas software doesn't seem to read the velocities of other cars and pedestrians well. The rep seems to think the Tesla isn't programed to see potholes. Which we have seen from the MVIS Lidar video to be a key point. In the video the Tesla has a hard time reading curbs, pillions and a fence/ wall and by now im sure we've heard of at least one Tesla crash. This leads me to believe that Autonomous driving will be regulated and Elon could eventually be forced to use Lidar as Lidar could eventually become a mandatory sensor in all new cars, especially Autonomous. .

(Youtube video links are not allowed here but you can look up Waymo's self driving videos vs FSD beta 8.2 in Oakland )

Tesla's ""Full self driving"" at times acts drunk and requires the driver to continually disengage the auto driving feature. While in Waymo's case passengers are sitting in the rear seat separated by Plexiglas and there is no one to take grab the wheel and over, to me that means Waymo is more advanced and confident in their tech.

This in my opinion Is great news for MicroVision $MVIS investors considering their ""Best in class Lidar"" is coming out in April and is going to be a two in one Camera and Lidar Combo under $1000

This is great news for MicroVision for the following reasons (not in chronological order):

""Waymo began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009.""

Sevals Oz the recently appointed MVIS director held a previous position for google\[X\] was ""Self driving cars- HEAD of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT""

$Ford and $GOOGL ""come together in first-of-its-kind partnership to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to accelerate Ford‚Äôs transformation plan""

Ford pledges $29 billion for Evs and Autonomous Vehicles

Ford backs out of $VLDR ( alsoVLDRs CEO backs down saying the company has fostered a anti share holder culture.)

Former Ford executive of 32 years, Judy Curran is added to the Microvision BOD.

Microvision's CEO has continually stress the fact that he wants to maximize share holders value and has stated he wants to burn the shorts.

Look at Waymo's website, while they maybe ahead on the software side but I'm sure they are dying to to remove ALL of those big bulky sensors and increase aerodynamics and decrease drag coefficients . Thats why Microvision is so important to them. I'm sure Waymo and google are eager to release a car to the public especially after seeing teslas falsely advertised ""Full Self Driving""

Waymo Via has been learning to self drive class 8 trucks for 4 years now.

When clarifying the A Sample in Microvisions ER CEO Sharma mentions Long haul trucking for the first time in the following quotes:

""Our solid-state, long-range LiDAR sensor could enable any interested party to perform testing with our sensor on their moving platforms, such as cars and longhaul trucks""

..""No, that's A sample. That's where it's up for sale. So as I said, potentially, if somebody wants to work the hardware on a moving platform test because obviously, we're not investing in moving platform testing on cars or long-haul trucking""

Could they already be working with Google? Lets not forget Microvisions Board of Directors and their Google/ Ford ties..

A look at Microvisions Board:

CEO: Summit Sharma : Former Head of operations for Google glass

Seval Oz: Former Google Self driving cars- head of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Mark Spitzer: Former Operations Director at Google

Judy Curran: 32 years at Ford, in Director and head engineer roles. Current Head of automotive strategy at ANSYS

Microvision is up for sale, and to me it appears google is making moves..  I don't see anyone from Microsoft there (Even though Microvision is inside the Halolens 2) .. I could imagine the bidding war is In full swing as both of the Tech giants seem to have planted their roots in MicroVision. We all know about the Value the Near eye display brings to MSFT. At this point Im starting to believe MVIS will be acquired by Google due to the value MVIS could bring to their Autonomous Vehicle sensors, Heads up displays, Augmented and Mixed reality, and interactive projections


EDIT: For everyone saying camera vision is all you need and LIDAR is doomed. Check out what the simple application of what LIDAR did to the camera in the new iPhones and iPads, all the new features and laser fast focus, the accuracy and precision, the extra data and speed of it, which allows the computer to use less battery and processing power. I‚Äôm not saying camera vision is wrong, I‚Äôm saying they need LIDAR to pair with it, LIKE THE MICROVISION LIDAR AND CAMERA UNIT. They need the same data source of data with zero latency between them to bring any self driving car to scale. Im not saying radar can‚Äôt be used in conjunction but LIDAR lasers and the speed of light is faster than radio waves as their waves are longer and use less frequencies and make radar irrelevant and more of a redundancy. LIDAR can use more frequent programmable pulses and use time of flight senors to read velocity and create a point cloud of 33 Million p/s with multiple Fields of view. If autonomous driving is regulated and OEMS are required to use LIDAR and a bundle of sensors, Tesla will be in a bad position being so behind in LIDAR. 

Yahoo Finance talked about Microvision and autonomous vehicles this week in their article titled  ""Two Tech Stocks To Watch As Biden Pours Trillions Into The Green Economy"" and I quote ""And [all] these automakers‚Äô ambitious plans aren‚Äôt possible without companies like MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS). MicroVision is one of the industry‚Äôs leaders in LIDAR technology, the tech that helps autonomous vehicles ‚Äúsee‚Äù when driving. The technology will be a main driver in the adoption of the next auto-revolution, and MicroVision is already pushing the tech to the next level.

The stock recently had a 35% rundown over the past few weeks, and I think we‚Äôve hit a great entry point.

First, they‚Äôve been paying down their debt and now have none:

&#x200B;

[How often do you see debt going in that direction?](https://preview.redd.it/vftslruv8on61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bbf8be8888539a7d4d70115385f88e4afec0d)

&#x200B;

Next, they‚Äôve been increasing revenue consistently:

Due to their strong fundamentals and decades long cash runway and profitability just around the corner, they‚Äôre considered fairly undervalued at this point:

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm all in on this. I‚Äôm putting my money where my mouth is and throwing down my life savings of a couple hundred k (CAD):

AMRN is about to become profitable after years of uncertainty. There was concern over generics edging in on AMRN's market after they won a court case, but as it turns out they're not doing much and now AMRN is gaining footholds in the EU and Asia where generics have no claim (all the while filing appeals and injunctions against the generics). AMRN has no debt, a decades-long cash runway, and a promising product that‚Äôs doing well in America and is about to be introduced to two other huge markets, with more to follow in the future. Sure, it could go to $20, $40, or beyond. Hell, it‚Äôs been to $1,300 before, who knows. There‚Äôs also talk of a buyout by big pharma at some point.

But in my bones what I do suspect is that it will go back to fluctuate between $10 and $20 driven either by earnings/growth or speculation the next time there's a milestone. When it does, I plan to make a quarter of a million bucks.

**BONUS DD:** To market drugs in the EU, you need a pass from the European Commission, which defers its research to a subcommittee called the CHMP. Generally, if the CHMP passes it, the EC passes it. The window for the EC to pass it is usually 67 days. AMRN received a positive result from CHMP, and the 67 day counter started when that came out Jan 28, 2021 (48 days ago as of March 17).

&#x200B;

we can clearly see this has broken up. i bought shares earlier today on a dip and i bought more on close. this constitutes half my portfolio. it closed above the triangle pattern and above that red line which we have failed to close above previously. we also closed above the blue line (leading line from the ichimoku cloud) This constituted a big win for the bullcase. Also RSI is rising in what seems to be a a double bottom aka big balls  which should follow up like an erection if price continues moving up. these are rather bullish. there is the risk of this being a fake out though volume is nice and large so I fancy the bull scenario more but ill still be ready to buy more if needed if it drops to around $7.5

i saw online that a some insiders bought shares at $10 and around $8 so i feel this as good trade as long as ur in below $10 or unless insiders start cashing out. i also seen a bunch of bullish DD. ive also been seeing multiple TA charts being posted and are bullish.

 ive lost more money than i have made and this isnt financial advice

From this and the past few days (closing at exactly $25 a couple days, closing at $24.5 today - sound familiar?), we KNOW that RKT is being manipulated. The boringness is intentional, to get you to lose interest and seek ""better opportunities"" elsewhere. We've seen this previous in GME when it was flat at $50-60 for quite a while before shorts covered again.

In the short term and without major news, stock trading is a zero-sum game: every dollar the HF make comes from YOUR realized losses. The goal is to convince you that you should take a loss here and FOMO somewhere else. This is where you need to have some conviction. You might lose out on opportunity cost? Well the shorts also lose out on opportunity cost. While some stocks will have long term shorts (like GME when it seemed like it was going to bankruptcy), that is because there is an end game for shorts there (when the company reaches eventual bankruptcy). Is RKT going to bankrupt any time soon? No, they are growing fast and taking more market shares than competitors. The shorts in RKT are short-term shorts, especially the ones who shorted at $40. They were making a risky play there - RKT had the potential to squeeze higher. This means that they will look to take profits sooner rather than later and look for opportunities elsewhere.

Remember, pigs get slaughtered. Have some conviction; hold through the calm and you will be rewarded with the storm (hopefully a tornado to lift up your portfolio to the moon).

P.S. this doesn't apply to all stocks - most meme stocks will slowly bleed for many months or years after a spike and you will be left bag holding - that's true opportunity cost. You need to examine the underlying company and think about the situation in your opponents' (shorts) shoes.",1616046663.0

I‚Äôm a 24 year old student who started investing a few months ago and would like to talk a bit about Nano Dimensions. 
The sources for the information below has been taken from Yahoo Finance, Interviews with the CEO, Videos that the company has made, other DD‚Äôs that had info I found to be usefull. Hope y‚Äôall like it. 

**What does Nano Dimensions do?**

First off. They sell 3D printers that can print all kinds of complex electric components like circuit boards, capacitators, antennes, sensors and SEMI CONDUCTURS.  Which Biden signed the executive order for because of the shortage of those at the end of last month. The CEO has a good track record. This ain‚Äôt his first Rodeo. Been involved in Aerospace, Security etc. Eli David is on the Board of Directors.


**Now why would anyone buy those printers?
Well a bunch of reasons.**

1. No outsourcing of production which saves them money. 

2. Increases confidentiality cause customers build their own IP. (E.g: Important for Defense/Medical)

3. Time saving since customers are able to get their prototypes within hours instead of days-weeks. 

4. Eco Friendly cause less waste compared to current manufacturing process

5. Automated printer = less operator maintenace

6. Able to be used 24/7

7. Their machines are just so much more efficient. E.g; The more layers a circuit board has, the more complex the manufacturing is right? Not for these printers. Nano Dimension's printers can print up to 30 layers at the same cost and ease as one with 2 layers. 

8. Will become able to be used in space. Whole lot cheaper to have some electronic component manufactured right there instead of having to send something into space. *CEO said that they will test the materials in Space and plan to manufacture Products for the use in Space. But for now they don't play to produce in space, that would contradict their plans for the automatic factory.*


**Financials:**

They did a bunch of offerings. Any shareholder might know that it‚Äôs been a bumpy ride. But it‚Äôs been worth it. 
Currently they‚Äôre sitting at little below $1.5 Billion cash and zero debt.
Market cap: $2.81B

**Revenue:**

2019 4thQ: $1.977.000

2020 3rdQ: $438.000

2020 4th Q: $1.971.000


This is a $6k YoY decrease from their 2019 4thQ Revenue. 
Now why isn‚Äôt this really that bad of a signal? Most of their revenue comes from selling these printers. These go for hundreds of thousands. Due to covid a lot of entities decided to hold off on capital expenses causing a major dip in revenue. But even tho covid is for the most part still around; we have seen a major spike compared to the previous quarter as capital expenses have started to open up for some of them. They were expected to have a lot less revenue and managed to hold pretty strong under the current circumstances.

**What about competition?**
Well tbh. Atm there ain‚Äôt no competition. Literally no one. These guys secured the patents. If this pops off they taking it all. 

**So where's the money coming from?**
They sell to Defense, Research Institutions, Automotive, Medical, fucking everywhere. I mean its electrical products they're making. What industry doesn‚Äôt use them? 

**Revenue streams:**

**1. Printer Sales**
As I said, these machines go for hundreds of thousands.  70% of customers renews their machine every time a new one comes out. They like the tech. So big chance that any new customer will buy more than 1 printer. Which ofc. also means years of recurring revenue and maintenance contracts.

**2. Recurring Revenue**
The blades and material need to be replaced.

**3. Nanoservices**
This is an interesting one. Last year they barely sold machines since companies atm lack the budget for these printers. However revenue was better than expected since customers who are currently lacking the budget come and pay for Nano Dimensions to print their project for them. Can be anywhere from $5-20k per project. 
The thing thats good here is, its a great opportunity for them to build a relationship with their customers and make them more familiar with the tech. CEO expects many of these customers to start buying the machines when their budgets open up post covid, causing a sling shot effect in sales. 

**4. Maintenance contracts**
Speaks for itself

So where is their potential growth? 

1.	They will release a new printer this year. *New Printer-Generation will be announced early summer, shipping will be possible eoy*
2.	They are still looking for more new types of electrical components to manufacture. *They are looking into nano-mechanical devices as well*
3. They are looking for acquisitions in 2 types of companies. I'll explain more on that below
4.	They are planning on making printers that will be able to be used for production instead of prototyping/testing. Some defense companies already use this as production because the projects they require aren‚Äôt possible to manufacture without these printers.
Now I don‚Äôt think I gotta explain why that‚Äôs a good thing.
Once their machines are able to be used for production that will open a completely new door to them  I believe 2022 is what the CEO said IIRC. 

**Acquisitions**

Now this $1.5B is gonna come in handy. It will be shares and cash for these acquisitions tho.  However the CEO refuses to enter the ‚Äúrat race‚Äù where private companies have become overvalued and is taking his time to decide, refusing to overpay. Says he is in talks with multiple companies atm. 

Now the 2 types of companies they are looking to acquire are:

**Type A**: Companies that can help them with distribution and are working in the pcb industry. Market cap of $50-200M. 

**Type B**: Companies that have tech that they want to own and/or think is going to be big in 2-3 years.

Note: *One of the european ones will be a producer of machines, prop. central or eastern europe, to help them reducing their time to market for Dragonfly NG*

**Risks**

There is always a chance of them doing more offerings, although I don‚Äôt see that happening personally. *CEO made clear that they did not plan it in the near future.*
This is right now a niche market but with years will become huge imo. If you want something to daytrade this stock might not be it for you. It can be very volatile so if that‚Äôs not your thing stay away too. Also if they don‚Äôt spend this $1.5B wisely, investors may lose trust after having shares diluted a bunch of times. Personally I trust the CEO because of his track record with acquiring companies and taking his time, refusing to overpay for companies. 


That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got. 
Would like to hear some feedback. Anyone else invest in Nano Dimensions? What‚Äôs ya‚Äôll opinions on the company and the future share price? Good investment or waste of time?


**TLDR; GOOD STOCK. BUY WHEN RED. CHECK BACK IN 5 YEARS.**

It was a solid day today, even with the uncertainty today due to waiting on the fed's decision whether or not to increase the interest rates. Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. \~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked \~4% from today's low. That's awesome.  


ICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023  
SOURCE: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html)  


What does this mean, you ask?   
Interest rates are also known as the ""price of money"". Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  


For the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   


For ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word ""money"" in the sentence above with ""banana"". Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  


What else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?  
Low volume. Extremely low volume. From [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com), this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  


We are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there's a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I'm currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:  
\-No interest rate hikes  
\-$BB still holding that strong uptrend  
\-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly  
\-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.  
\-Triple Witching. Read this if you don't know what this is.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)  


With tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  


Right now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.  
If $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at \~14.44.  


Enjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  


Take care.",1616044920.0

**6/6 Last but not least: Prediction -  Price predictions using different Machine learning models**

For the Machine learning models I set the data range to 2020-01-01 where needed. This allows for more testdata to train the model on, unfortunately the models are not perfect and thus easily confused by spikes, and drops. Just don't call me a shill if a AI decides that GME does not go to the moon (because we all know it will go to the moonüöÄ)

The models predict prices for the next 5 days.

**Ok, there we go: SMA**

This post is gonna be long and in order to understand it, you need to understand how market makers works. If you don‚Äôt understand that concept, that‚Äôs fine. A simple google search will yield sources better than me, that can provide you a basic understanding of market makers and short selling. So try doing a quick search to educate yourself then come back here

# The GME-market wide Correlation

So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December, it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market.

Hence, when the market has major red days across multiple sectors, GME is still green among a sea of red. 

And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up. Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation.

When you align charts of GME since December, with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq, it‚Äôs like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest

# So why is this happening?

Well the simplified explanation is this. When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions (like Melvin capital for example), it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called.

So for example, when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position. This is pretty basic stuff

# But this isn‚Äôt a normal Short Squeeze

The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets, was the fact that GME‚Äôs short percentage reached a height of **140%**

But what does a 140% float mean?

Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed?

Well yes, that‚Äôs called naked shorting but it‚Äôs more complicated than that.

# How Naked Shorts work

When a naked short is created, it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower. So when you see 140% short percentage that doesn‚Äôt mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting, it means when these institutions (Melvin) heavily shorted GME, the Market Makers (Citadel) **created** shares out of thin air, and **tethered** them to the real shares that were borrowed. These made up shares are synthetic shares, they don‚Äôt actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares.

This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher. I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing, sorry I don‚Äôt have a time stamp but today‚Äôs hearing is worth watching if you have the time.

# The Big Short

So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to ‚ÄúSynthetic CDO‚Äôs‚Äù from the 2008 crisis. I‚Äôm using synthetic CDO‚Äôs as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie, ‚ÄúThe Big Short.‚Äù These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO‚Äôs.

So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital, trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares.

This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality, **they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one, and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money**

# Now to talk about the current squeeze

It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with **Infinite risk**. This is how short squeezes happen, if the price is driven up, the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender, which then further increases the price of a share, and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze.

The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze. Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post, at $215/share, but it‚Äôs price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up.

# But here is the the important part

The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed, the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the **synthetic shares only become ‚Äúreal‚Äù when the short position completely closes or is margin called.**

This means, the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number.

So you don‚Äôt need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous, once the synthetic shares come to fruition.

We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares, and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money. But that doesn‚Äôt stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares.

So The MM‚Äôs are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now, except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb.

# Now why it‚Äôs scary for the rest of the market

So if you‚Äôve been following to this point, you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic. 

**Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation... I don‚Äôt think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts. The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in this short position.**

So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs (I‚Äôm talking in the billions of dollars) across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee, and I don‚Äôt think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost.

I believe, with great conviction, when GME truly takes off it will cause, a major market-wide correction across all sectors.

# The Conclusion

Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals (maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market).

I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because ~~the way these contract expiry dates are usually set~~ the number of option contracts set around those dates. And It‚Äôs possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time.

However, I can say 2 things with absolute certainty

* We are witnessing history, this whole thing is already resulting in many academic studies, further government intervention, and future movies/documentaries
* **There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again.**

I do not care what broker you have, fidelity, E\*TRADE, Schwab, or robinhood, etc.  They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys (and very possibly sells) just like RH did on January 28th. When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS

**And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion, I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing.** The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January. 

# THIS WILL NOT BE THE BROKERS FAULT, THE MARKET MAKERS AND HEDGE FUNDS SHOULD BE THE ONES FOOTING THE BILL, EVEN IF THAT MEANS SELLING OFF EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THEIR BUILDING TO DO SO.

Mainstream Brokers only have so much money to provide the liquidity needed to move billions of trades a day, they are not equipped to deal with something this insane.

# So Why did I type up this long ass post?

If you think I‚Äôm just a crazy person, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt take it personally. I‚Äôm just making this post because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months. I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders.

I know GME is a ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù so it‚Äôs easy to discredit and it‚Äôs fun watching this David vs Goliath story but I believe this will have very real effects across the whole market so proceed with caution on your trades until this squeeze reaches a conclusion, **ESPECIALLY IF YOU DEAL WITH NAKED OPTIONS**

If you read this whole thing, thanks. Please let me know if there is any corrections I should make.

TLDR: just skim the bold points ya lazy fuck lol

Edit: gonna have to turn off notifications now lol. So I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt reply, maybe later. 

But most importantly I‚Äôm no professional, I‚Äôm just a guy with an interest in the world of finance. So don‚Äôt take this post as gospel. I wanted to start this thread for the discussion and while I do strongly personally believe the MOASS is real, I appreciated the counter points.

Thanks for the laughs and genuine discussion",1616041930.0

Obviously even if we don't hit 10$ friday this is a big win. Firstly for everyone already on board since more gains, secondly because then the stock, who got beaten down in the last weeks even though there was no reason, outperformed the market 2 days in a row already -> big fish will be interested.

# Why should $UWMC go up further?

UWMC is going to be included in the **Russell 1000 & 3000** \- that is a GOOD thing. Often inclusions into indexes lead to higher share prices (as seen with **tesla** when it was included into SP500 and went from **520 to 700+$**)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Why am I making this post:

&#x200B;

Nearly every day in the last 2 weeks we saw crazy price movement, often brutal dips in post or premarket. Both are due to low volume and often a lower open then we closed the day prior.

&#x200B;

This often leads to people seeing their investment of yesterday is red, so they panic sell. That can drop the shareprice further.

&#x200B;

DONT BE AFRAID! UWMC had the habit of doing that, but most of the time (at least the few days leading to today) it always recovered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

IF we manage to hit 10$ at some point friday, oh shit we are in a lot of tendies. Tons of call options could be exercised thus pushing price up even more!

&#x200B;

Let the force of the smoothbrains be with us!

(I just saw 9.63 afterhours, if it hits 10 I will try to exercise my 10$ calls early, just because I like the stock)

Many on this forum are putting a lot of money in to options without having shares. To me it seems that the hedges see this and can easily calculate price points to create floors and ceilings at whim, and maximize their own gains despite our ‚Äúwonderful DD‚Äù and predictions. You can see it in plenty of stocks that we discuss daily. Rkt for example, I see everyone flooding the market with calls, yet without stocks to back it up, the calls suffer, there‚Äôs no volume to back up these bets. 

Another note, the more apes seem to post ‚Äúsure dates‚Äù the less likely it happens. There‚Äôs more than hedges taking advantage of the influx, there‚Äôs plenty of WSB users doing the same I imagine, and many are being had and are day trading to minimize loses or move their funds to the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. This is proven to cause, overall, loses to the retail investor. If you decide throwing your money into something, be aware that you may be falling into trap (RKT $40). Be cautious of ‚Äúthe next gme‚Äù. We‚Äôve seen plenty of ‚Äúbots/shills‚Äù comments.

Lastly, the more we spam a single stock, the more I believe big players will simply change strategy to account for the ‚Äúmod mentality‚Äù surrounding this sub currently.

Disclaimer, yadda yadda yadda...

Actually, I am not a financial advisor, believe it or not. I can't in good conscience recommend anyone follow me on this, especially for a main reason I list below...

We all know it, let's skip to the good stuff, shall we? Don't need any TLDR activity here... I must warn you, there are some emotional elements at play in this particular version of my DD. I am NOT a fan of organized religion. And these stocks are what we might term ""vice"" stocks. I know emotions do not often play into successful due dilligence of stocks, but there is an important element to this that COULD give Sundial a slight advantage. Read on.

&#x200B;

The bottom line is, Sundial Growers has been around a LOOOOONG time... well, long enough to know that a dollar and something stock that at it's greatest height only saw a $13.01 share price back in July of 2019, only to immediately drop below ten bucks a month later, never to recover again. IS there truly any hope for this stock??

&#x200B;

2021 COULD be the breakout year for Sundial... Let's take a look at a few hopefuls...

&#x200B;

""According to New Frontier data, cannabis sales in the U.S. are expected to grow by 21% annually between 2019 and 2025..."" Gee, so really more of a long term expectation for Sundial. And the way it's rising and falling now, that earnings report on March 17th (NOW pushed back to March 18th, at 10:30 AM EST according to the official Sundial Growers website) is going to make investors VERY nervous... Especially if the earnings aren't ""through the roof."" What do YOU think is gonna happen?

&#x200B;

MY analysis is MAYBE a $2 price, IF WE'RE LUCKY... And that is all dependent on SNDL having a STELLAR breakthrough in their earnings report... But that's MY opinion, and I could be dead wrong.

&#x200B;

Here's what we DO know: to MY eyes, the biggest ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for Sundial is in it's economics. And it's sitting on, according the The Motley Fool, ""A monstrous cash pile."" All that money and nowhere to go, eh? Following a 74.5 million registered direct offering in early February, Sundial straight up stated in had 610 MILLION in unrestricted cash on it's balance sheet... WOW... ""An additional 89 million worth of warrants were exercised just weeks later."" Now, I don't know much about warrants, but it states Sundial has in the neighborhood of 700 million in cash to ""go shopping.""

&#x200B;

I'd be interested to know how much of that cash is still around as of March 17th... It's St. Patty's day folks, what better time to blow cash on some green!!!

But that's not the most troubling thing on Sundial's agenda...

&#x200B;

In my mind, one of the reasons for Sundial's continued ""under valuation,"" as I see it, is their unsavory abundance of shares in the marketplace. With a volume of 176 million and an average volume of 339 million... That's a LOT of shares out there, and Sundial has been known to ""dump shares"" from time to time...

&#x200B;

Oh, you didn't know this???

&#x200B;

Now Reddit interest in the stock being set aside for the minute, let's take a look at what Sundial did to gain all that money...

""Sundial Growers' board OK'd a shelf offering that would allow it to sell a mixed basket of securities to raise up to $1 billion over time. Put another way, its board OK'd the company to sell up to $1 billion more in common stock. This comes after a more than 1.1 billion increase in its outstanding share count since the end of September.""

&#x200B;

Motley Fool is right to speculate that that $700 million in cash COULD have been made on the backs of it's shareholders. So shares are going to be looked at more highly than the actual dollar values this time around. A rather DIFFERENT way of looking at an earnings report, isn't it?

Sundial has had it's share of problems in the past, though some might forgive it for currently going through an ""operating transition."" (Though in different sectors, ""operational transitions"" USUALLY work wonders for companies, like G.E. and GameStop).

&#x200B;

Per some sources, Sundial has until June 26, 2021 to keep the share price above $1 for ten consecutive days to keep it from being delisted. Okay, so maybe that's not as big a concern as you might think. If it IS, then by all means, make sure you dump it before June 26th! Seeing as how Sundial was at .81 in January of this year, it's NOT an unlikely possibility. Still, as heavily traded as this stock seems to be, it also seems unlikely shareholders will let it drop down too far...

&#x200B;

And remember that 13 dollar price when the stock first listed? The immediate drop was due to a scandal at ANOTHER pot company (CannTrust Holdings). Really more of a ""reaction"" at a scandal in another pot company. Smoke and mirrors? In this particular bit of news, CannTrust fired it's CEO and forced their President to resign due to revelations that CannTrust was ""illegally growing pot in unlicensed rooms.""

Whatever. We just noticed that the sudden drop in price occurred around this time. And once again, as we showed earlier, the price NEVER recovered above $10... NEVER.

Sundial's BIGGEST glaring errors come during the fall of 2019, when the company faced a class action lawsuit over mold and rubber contaminated pot shipments prior to going public... This obviously has damaged investors' prospects towards trusting in the company long term... Not to mention a returned half ton of pot during a ""roadshow presentation in Toronto.""

&#x200B;

In addition, EVERY report I've read shows that analysts do NOT recommend buying Sundial, from Motley Fool to Forbes, to Money Inc....

Here's the deal: Those SAME analysts were wrong about Game Stop. But for my money, there's a company in my mind that's a MUCH better play than Sundial: Tilray.

We can go into Tilray at another point, but the bottom line for me is the stock: 18 million in volume and 33 million in average volume.. That's a MUCH better line on number of shares floating around.

Not to mention when Tilray is down, they usually bounce back quite well... From $24.60 on March 11th to $28.96 the very next day, on up to $31.18 (a high for this month) on March 15th. One of the largest pot companies in North America is merging with Aphria, which makes this a MUCH better play for pot stocks in the interim...

&#x200B;

Bottom lime for Sundial? YES, their dollar amounts look good right now. They're not expanding as widely into the international market as, say, Tilray, but if they're not spending that hard cash on expanding the business, and we're not seeing any newsworthy items, what the fuck ARE they doing? Sundial, like many other pot companies, are waiting for U.S. federal restrictions to ease significantly before they become major players in the market. But as my friend pointed out, ""Why would Americans buy pot from Canada? YOU always hear people go ""Oh, man, have you tried that Jamaican strain,"" or Maui Wauwii? Or some of that Lebanese blond hash???"" You ever hear people go ""man, we gotta get some of that Canadian stank!""

&#x200B;

Here's the deal. If you want to invest in Sundial, I say go long. You may be waiting a bit, but here is where things get interesting. If you've been watching Roblox, Coupang, AirBnB and other brand new IPO's, here's something you may not have noticed...

&#x200B;

Here are the FIVE steps to becoming an IPO:

&#x200B;

1. Select a bank
2. Due diligence and filings
3. Pricing
4. Stabilization
5. Transition

&#x200B;

Oh, what you thought that shit happened overnight? Let's take a look at Coupang... For a quick example. Coupang, a wonderful company who reached IPO status, started up in 2010...

Damn, ELEVEN years to become an IPO??

Let's look at Roblox. No wait, let's go back to Coupang (quick answer: Roblox delayed it's IPO from

December until March of this year).

&#x200B;

SELECT A BANK...

This is the biggest, and most crucial thing, for people to recognize and understand in America. Out of those FIVE things you need to become an IPO, Banking is CRITICAL...

&#x200B;

Well, unless you realize there are different ways to fund your IPO... But banking statements and keeping accurate financial records are CRUCIAL. Especially if you wanna play with the big boys on the NASDAQ and the NYSE. You can't go ""Well, Joe Bob has our money in his strongbox at home. Joe, how much money you got in there?""

&#x200B;

The short answer is, for American companies, the NYSE and the NASDAQ ""have stood their ground on not allowing any marijuana stocks to list on their exchanges that do business in the United States.""

&#x200B;

Oh.

And back to the banking aspect of things? Well, strict financial qualifications relegate many American pot stocks to the OTC, or Over The Counter, market. And even IF, or WHEN legalisation comes from the federal level, I predict that Canadian companies will have a HUGE advantage over American companies.

&#x200B;

But only for a short time...

&#x200B;

Let's use Georgia as a guinea pig for example to explain why.

&#x200B;

Even IF banks in this country decide ""okay, it's legal now, we'll go ahead and fund the American companies,"" you still have that Southern Bible Belt mentality that permeates government and governmental legislation...

&#x200B;

I'm about to get nasty on religion, so if that bothers you PLEASE by all means, EXIT STAGE LEFT,

IMMEDIATELY....

&#x200B;

To the rest of you, Georgia is a GREAT case study. First off, it's one of the ONLY states in the union to STILL have a monopoly on the electricity market. Yes, Georgia Power runs things in the South.

The good 'ole buddy system...

Second, it took until 2011 to legalize Sunday alcohol sales. And fortunately, that was done with a city wide vote, letting each city vote and guess what? Not ONE single city in Georgia turned down Sunday alcohol sales... What was the driving factor? Let's look at a few other Georgia ""fails"" in the bible belt.

&#x200B;

Fireworks were not made legal until 2015, and it took until 2018 to ""straighten out the fireworks laws"" so that something legal in one city was NOT illegal in another.

Georgia legalized the lottery in 1993... That might not sound like a big deal, but you might not know the history of the lottery...

""New Hampshire established the first state lottery in 1964, and the games soon spread throughout the Northeast. By 1978, every state between Maryland and Maine had a lottery. In the 1980s, lotteries went West, as 18 more states, from Virginia to California, authorized lotteries. Most holdouts were in the South, but three Southern states authorized lotteries in the 1990s, and five more in the 2000s.""

&#x200B;

Only 6 states are still holding out.

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, that ""good 'ole boy"" system is still in place in the banking institutions, so don't assume that banks will just automatically lend money to pot stocks... And that deep hellfire baptist tradition is still in vogue in politics, so anything the bible thumpers deem ""immoral"" (gambling, drinking, fireworks, you know, anything us ""regular folks"" enjoy to have a good time) will get shot down as emphatically as it can...

Kudos to the states that have done legislation on marijuana already. But we all remember how vehemently ""the south"" fought gay marriage, Chick Fil-A and Hobby Lobby being the two latest discriminatory elements in the ""play by OUR god's rules"" mentality...

So long and short, I have 230 shares of Sundial. That will more than likely change after tomorrow. The general consensus is that Sundial is strictly a long term play, and not an extremely positive one at that. IF legislation opens up at the federal level, you should have some time until the American companies come in full force. That last statement I made about Georgia seems like an emotional decision, but I HAVE seen how long it takes to ""Straighten things out"" once the religious zealots get out of the way. Will it get to over $2 a share? Possibly...

Anything can happen. However, public sentiment should be considered as well as the fact that legalization, on a federal level, isn't likely to happen very soon...

623,AMD to Jump 50% Soon to $120 and Here's Why,373,m79506,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79506/amd_to_jump_50_soon_to_120_and_heres_why/,160," AMD is trading around $80 right now, it's down about 16% from peak. It's movements are following the NASDAQ right now, meaning money managers are not trading AMD directly, they're just trading the entire NASDAQ. But they will be trading AMD soon and they will be buying. Here's why.

Dr. Lisa Su says they expect to grow 37% this year. She's always conservative on the numbers, more like 40% is realistic. Compared to Intel which is expecting 0% growth for 2021. Intel is being forced to slash prices to be competitive with AMD, which means reduced margins. Then they need to invest heavily in R&D to catch up to AMD. They also said they'll be using TSMC to make 3nm chips for them to help them catch up. Intel is a competitor to TSMC, so don't expect them to get any discounts. All of this leads to higher operating costs and further reduced margins. AMD will also be using the same 3nm from TSMC so don't expect Intel to pull away with a victory when the time comes (not for another 2 years), they're merely trying to catch up while they work on their own fab problems. It's possible that since AMD has such a lead, Intel may not catch up for the foreseeable future, >3 years. Remember AMD has a 100B market cap, Intel is 268B.

AMD holds 7% of the datacenter market, that number is about to skyrocket as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Tencent are going all-in on AMD powered servers. The datacenter is where the margins are the highest, this is what will make AMD serious cash, not their consumer products. And this is also where they have the most market share to gain, if they do it right, which they are.

Cramer on why he wants to buy more AMD stock:

Lisa Su on why the chip shortage is good for AMD and that they are ramping up supply to meet the new demand:  
On youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc

Current Price Target is $106 with a high of $161. My price target is $120. AMD stock history shows the stock tends to stay flat for months followed by a large jump within a 10 day period. I expect this to happen again. When will AMD jump? I don't know, but I expect it to happen within the next 3 months.

Last year I turned $1k into $87k with LOGI, I am now putting $50k into AMD, across stocks (350 shares) and several call options with expirations from April 2021 to June 2022.",1616039920.0

* **International Space Station:**
   * Nano Dimension reported that the radio-frequency integrated circuit that it made, which was designed and integrated by L3Harris, has been sent to the International Space Station. The project will provide an analysis of an additively manufactured single board for radio frequency space systems, especially for nanosatellites, and will communicate with a ground-based satellite tracking system. The main purpose of the project is to demonstrate the viability of using new technologies to produce monolithic radio frequency communication systems for use in space.

Now, Nano Dimension has broadened the view of itself into a 3D-printed-technology device company, she said. One of the important things about the Nano Dimension story is their contracts they are winning from defense agencies. ‚ÄúWe always look for where the defense is putting their money,‚Äù Wood said.

637,Shorts Attacking RKT: Business and Stonk Holding Firm,253,m77ls8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m77ls8/shorts_attacking_rkt_business_and_stonk_holding/,98,"TLDR: I  believe that we, the individual investor now owns over 100% of the float of RKT. (35% float short)  RKT will do fine in the ""mortage slowdown"" coming off a record 2020 and Hedgies will cover and the stock will have to explode higher. 

Here Long version DD:

RKT came public at $18 back in August.  In IPOs they sell to mutual funds, hedge funds etc.  Rkt was presented and purchase by bank portfolio managers.  Banks are boring.  When you have a mutual fund or hedge fund, the oldest fart in the room trades the utilities, the second oldest trades the bank stocks.

But we know RKT is not a bank stock, its a fin tech stonk.  The valuations of fintec are white hot!  see SQaure, Paypal, even that POS Lightspeed.  The market is paying insane multiples of revenue, even when they lack good profits, or in the case of lightspeed no profit.  RKT can be a $60+ stock if fairly valued.  Q1 is not going to be a bust, and they have a history of squeeking out profits in even the worst market.

Ask yourself this:  how did Gilbert build this into the largest in the whole world while maintaining almost 100% ownership?  He never needed to sell stock to raise cash, the only owners are him (90%) management and employees (5%) and us (5%).   They profited all along the way and grew the business with good old fashion cash flow profits.

RKT is a cash machine with double digit long term growth potential.  Now 2020 was a 'peak' earnings year.  \~$4.50/share is not a regular thing.  But a core earnings rate of \~$2 to $3/share average each year that grows long term 10-20%/year i think is a reasonable number.

So ask yourself, what do i pay for just $2.50/share of long term earnings power that grows 10-20%.  Most S&P500 companies are only growing a few percent a year.  They are not innovative but trade around 30x earnings.  Even if $2/share is the 'normal' mortgage market earnings rate, this should be better than $60/share!!!!

Short thesis is dumb:

Hedge funds have shorted nearly 40 mil shares as of the last report.  They are trading 2 'negative' data points:

1) Slowing mortgage market because rates are up 1/2%.  RKT made a lot on refis, and that was a sweet bump in 2020 that we won't see in 2021.  

2) Mortgage Service Rights are market to ""rates"", and rates up means a non-cash write down

\-The truth: refis will slow in 2021, but mortgage market will still be strong.  RKT will make plenty of money on the new mortgage biz, but earnings of $2/share on the new morgage side is more reasonable without the refi-kicker bonanza of 2020.

\-Mortgage service rights are always profitable, they collect a payment fee from the bank to bill the customer through their platform.  Thats the asset here, they estimate the value at the time of origination and if rates go up they 'discount' the future cash.  The cash is still coming just fine and its keeps them cash positive in new mortgage down turns.  That write down may knock a buck or so off earnings in the next quarter or two, but thats really just a 'reversal' of the valuation that gave us the $4.50 of profit last year.

Thats why i estimate the average earnings power of the business: $2-$3/share.  Some years it bumps above, other years they have to write it back down, but thats the long term average and its growing, i think 10-20%/year long term.  Hedge funds want to shake people out when revenues and earnings reverse this quarter or next.  But the power of this business makes hay across the whole cycle.  I don't care  about a couple of soft quarters with RKT is so far below fetching a good multiple of earnings.

Short panicing and selling the stock down.

Would it surprise you to learn that they have been shorting millions of more shares in the last 2 days?  They are desparately trying to bust this stock, and i think they ahve already failed and this will be the next, ehem, rocketing short that busts one or more big hedgefunds.  Here is the borrow availability for the last 2 days:

After looking into it for 20 min, my OpenAI friend put it best:

    ‚ÄúHoly sh*t girl, this is seriously just the Establishment pretending to tech!!‚Äù

But before digging into the details of this farce‚Äîsorry, ~~SaaS~~ company, let me first give a shout out to u/indonesian_activist, u/BenjaminFernwood, and everyone else who supported me and my options analytics tool (which I will make available to all you ü¶çü¶çü¶ç ASAP so you can visualize real-time implied price probabilities on any ticker of your choice at any time! Keep tabs on that GME!!!) Your upvotes have enabled this ex-hedgie quant girl to make her first ever DD post üòÉüòÉ (aka this one).

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs break down why you should sell** **C3.AI** **from 3 supporting perspectives:**

**(1)	The fundamentals perspective**

**(2)	The quant perspective (where we'll look at 2 specific good-looking options trades to put on)**

**(3)	The apes-vs-hedgies perspective**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**(1)  The fundamentalist argument:**

&#x200B;

* **Terrible revenue growth:** C3.ai IPO‚Äôed on Dec. 8, 2020, and reported its first quarterly (Q3) earnings on Mar 1, 2020. Stock plunged >30% that week, from $120 to $85. What happened?! Growth numbers sucked. Top line was basically flat to decreasing throughout COVID (\~1% QoQ in April 2020, -2% in July, +2% in Oct). Clearly nobody had the frivolous time to listen to Tom Siebel‚Äôs buzzwordy service offerings in a down economy. Then finally on March 1, after riding the coattails of IPO hype, the company finally reported 19% QoQ growth. But nobody was impressed because that‚Äôs still too damn shabby to justify a valuation more than 65x TTM revenue.
* **Overblown multiple:** Today, even after sliding 30%, C3 is still valued at \~51x price to revenue, which is insane! For reference, comparable B2B AI/ data analytics companies (aka consulting services and abstraction layers on top of Hadoop & Tensorflow) are only 10x-15x at best:

Alteryx: 11.7x (23% QoQ growth in most recent quarter)

Sumo Logic: 11.2x (30% YoY growth)

Cloudera: <5x (12% YoY growth)

* The only other similarly valued comparable is Palantir at \~44x. Bulls (aka Wall Street‚Äôs sycophantic sell side analysts) may use PLTR as a lame justification for C3‚Äôs current valuations, but unlike C3 Palantir is actually looking at real 45% QoQ revenue growth‚Äîmore than DOUBLE that of C3‚Äôs, even while maintaining a 700% bigger denominator (PLTR‚Äôs annual recurring revenue is \~$1.4B)! Comparing C3 to PLTR is like comparing your wife's boyfriend to Emma Watson!!
* **Enormous customer concentration and churn risk**: C3‚Äôs top 3 customers accounted for 44% of total revenue in 2020 and the top 2 accounted for 36%. Imagine if one of those contracts churned. Then what? Oh, and in case you were wondering who those lucky titans are: Baker Hughes and Engie. Any value C3 provides these oil moguls just goes toward accelerating global pollution. In fact, in 2020 59% of sales came from the oil and gas industry! Just lovely. I really want to meet the biz dev genius who said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go after the most capex intensive customers, cuz they surely gots the free cash flows to be loose with their wallets!‚Äù Uncle Siebel seemed to realize this gaffe only once he decided to go public. Now C3 is chasing after ‚Äúhigh tech,‚Äù trying desperately to compete against Palantir/ Databricks/AWS and a cornucopia of other startups, including open source and in-house teams. Too late. Meanwhile it also changed its name TWICE from C3 Energy to C3.IoT to C3.AI‚Ä¶ Still think this is an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù company? ‚ÄòNuf said.
* **Even the Chief is bearish!** As soon as his 90-day post-IPO lockup expired on March 8, Siebel dumped 2.26 million shares! (See the SEC filing table below). Now just how big was this big dump? To give y‚Äôall some perspective, during the IPO in December, C3 sold just 15.5 million shares, so Siebel single-handedly increased the supply by 15%!!! How the F did he push all those shares through the dark pools? Oh, and he got to increase his net worth by $200M in the process. Not that he needed such pennies when he was already worth over $3.6B in 2018 from Oracle. Meanwhile, TPG reacted like ‚ÄúHuh? CEO and Chief Engineers taking big dumps? Ima üí© üí© along with them!‚Äù

But wait, there‚Äôs more to rip on Siebel and his management, um, skills‚Ä¶? During the Q3 earnings call, an analyst from Morgan Stanley named Peggy asked for the customer conversion rate (literally the second most important KPIs of any enterprise SaaS company, after revenue growth rate!!). And what did the Chief have to say?

* **Hasn't EVERYONE figured out by now this is a CONSULTING COMPANY??** What‚Äôs the big deal, you ask? What‚Äôs wrong with consulting? In case you‚Äôre not familiar with post-2010 Silicon Valley tropes, consulting => scalability no-go. When a company needs to build a custom ‚Äúproduct‚Äù for each new customer it onboards, it can only grow linearly with the number of TAMs and FDEs (forward-deployed solution engineers, aka consultants) it hires. In other words, ain‚Äôt no tendies to be made from operating leverage, ain‚Äôt no economies of scale, and ain‚Äôt no margin improvements to be expected down the pipeline. So how did C3 come to trade at higher-than-SaaS multiples? Easy. Tom Siebel is a veteran at the infinite ‚ÄúHot Potato‚Äù game: where at each funding round, VCs just keep betting that the next round will bring in new money even more willing to jack up valuation stakes until finally the pyramid peaks at the expense of ‚Ä¶ yep, you guessed it: public market retail investors (aka you, me, and the institutions managing our retirement plans). What does Siebel have to say about all this? ‚ÄúI mean we are focused on being a software company. We're not focused on being a software services company..."" Ok look, no real software company says they're focused on being one; they just are. (If you want even more cringeworthy Siebel quotes, just read the full earnings call transcript. And in case you wanted even more proof that C3 is a downright services business, just open up Linkedin. As of March 15, there are 603 profiles currently working at C3.AI: 195 (32%) turn up under the title ‚Äúforward deployed engineer,‚Äù 166 (28%) turn up under the title ‚Äúproduct manager,‚Äù and 188 (20%) turn up under the title ‚Äúsolution engineer.‚Äù In other words, 80% of the company is pre-or post- sale consultants.

**(2) The quant perspective (get ready for some stats):**

&#x200B;

That‚Äôs right, this ‚Äúfemale ex-hedgie quant‚Äù is back with her options visualizations. This time I promise to provide more explanations.

Let‚Äôs start with a simplified thought experiment that illustrates what‚Äôs going on with $AI. It‚Äôs March 16. 3 days before the nearest expiry. Current spot is $86.50. Say you ask 10 apes to set a price target for $AI on Mar 19. Assume 3 of the apes reply $75, 4 reply $80, 2 reply $105 and 1 replies $110. Mean estimate is therefore $86.50 (3\*$75 + 4\*$80 + 2\*$105 + 1\*$110)/10, which must necessarily equal the current spot price ‚Äì by definition, spot is the market expected value at any given moment. However, the mode from the 10 responses is $80, which is significantly less than mean; in other words, $80 is the maximum likelihood price target for Mar 19. So which is ‚Äúmore correct‚Äù? $86.5 or $80? And what explains the divergence?

If you think the ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù here ($110, maybe $105) are just foolishly off and believe they‚Äôll correct their views over the coming 3 days down to $90 or $95, then you should believe $80 is more correct. However if you think there truly is disproportionate risk to the upside in price movements for the next 3 days, then you should believe $86.50 to be more correct.

This simplified thought experiment paints a decent picture of what‚Äôs currently going on with $AI in the real markets. See graph below showing the price target estimates set by all active options traders (aka the implied probability distribution curve). While no options trader literally said ‚ÄúI think $AI will trade at X,‚Äù X can be solved-for mathematically for each transaction based on the purchase/sale price of the options contract and a method called Breeden-Litzenberger. If you want more details on the math, just DM me.

On the three closest expiry dates, the market assumes there is disproportionately higher downside risk in price movement. You can tell based on the skewed-right shape of the probability distribution curve (i.e. the peak a.k.a. ‚Äúmaximum likelihood estimate‚Äù is to the left of spot shown by the dotted line meaning most folks would set their price target below $86.19). So both fundamentals and quants agree that the stock has more to fall.

[buy puts in the \\""A\\"" and \\""B\\"" range](https://preview.redd.it/eywi6y48wmn61.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5bc31a2055fd196e7eeeecf2c36193b30182c7)

Now most importantly, where are there good trading opportunities??? How much üçóüçó can I expect to make?

* One play is to buy some close OTM April 16 puts if you think $AI has more to drop in the next month. Take a look at where I circled ‚ÄúA‚Äù on the graph.
* If you expect AI to hit 65 before expiry, you can buy the 75 strike puts (at $4.70 as of writing), and **realize an ROI of 530/470=113%.**
* Alternatively you can buy the 70 strike puts (at $3.10 as of writing) and realize an **ROI of 190/310=61%**
* Next, look at the pair of puts labeled ‚ÄúB‚Äù  for July 16 (one at  50 strike and one at 55). Remember how there‚Äôs the annual FY21 earnings release in May!?! If the entire Street hasn't awakened to their senses yet, this will be the catalyst. If $AI drops to $42 by mid-May and you buy the 55-strike puts today ($4.20 as of writing), you're looking at **an ROI of 880/420=210%!**
* Group ""C"" is overpriced. Don't buy those ITM puts!

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

(3) The ""apes vs. wall street"" argument

Thirdly and lastly, I present the ‚Äúus vs. the Street‚Äù perspective. Take a look at who‚Äôs currently long C3, ranked by % ownership from top to bottom. The story goes like this: growth equity investors (like TPG) get ‚Äúfirst dibs‚Äù at some valuation, pass the hot potato to banks and ‚Äúfast money‚Äù hedgies (like Tiger and Tudor) during IPO at some much higher valuation (where high net worth individuals get ‚Äúsecond dibs‚Äù), who then pass the hot potato weeks or months later to ‚Äúreal money‚Äù pension/mutual funds at even higher valuation (where apes like us keep our retirement plans‚Ä¶ so we get ‚Äúthird dibs‚Äù). But third dibs is last dibs; it‚Äôs a burden not a privilege. Because by that point, when the music stops, we apes get stuck with these overvalued tubers and there‚Äôs nobody lower down the totem pole to dump them onto.

https://preview.redd.it/enfthgxcwmn61.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb686f4f5a9026f503b36c92d6ab833a38a12c1

In case you thought you had no exposure to C3, think again! Do you own VTS? Does your 401(k) plan own it? Do you own small-cap indices? Mutual funds and ETFs are where bad stonks get swept under the rug to hide amongst the good ones because most retail investors don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt care enough to actually look at the full list of holdings!

ü¶çü¶çUnite, we apes gotta work together to cancel out all the bad stonks we're passively owning!! PUT 'em out!

645,Why I'm VERY bullish on GME this week - strange price action,2496,m76vks,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m76vks/why_im_very_bullish_on_gme_this_week_strange/,410,"There has been a lot of strange movement in GME stock price over the past couple of weeks, but today stands out for me. There are a few points to touch on, but essentially my thesis is based on [today's chart so far](https://imgur.com/gallery/fLe50gq) and a couple of key points.

#Today's Chart & Price Action

When market opened today, almost all technical indicators were very bullish for GME. This indicates that we should see some very strong bullish moves in price today.

A quick caveat - all technical analysis, and any natural price movement really, requires volume. Without volume, the price cannot move naturally, and technical analysis/indicators will eventually exhaust and fail.

Looking at the chart today, the price action was playing out somewhat as expected. It tested an early support around $210-211 before entering a rising channel for most of the morning. Indicators remained bullish for the entire time, but volume wasn't showing up. After two down days, this was a perfect opportunity to create a massive move and gap up - potentially causing a small squeeze. But nothing happened. Volume never showed up, and the move started to become exhausted.

At about 1PM, we started seeing the price test the lower end of the channel repeatedly. At this point, if we were going to see a bullish continuence, we would see a spike in volume to push it back up into the channel. We repeatedly didn't see this and it eventually failed. And then what happened? **Nothing.**

This failure to maintain the bullish move was a perfect opportunity for those holding short positions to pounce. They could have used a fairly minimal amount of capital to smack the price down, and likey blow right past this morning's support of $210 and maybe even break below $200. It was a golden opportunity, and literally nothing happened. Even now, at almost 2PM it is still trading sideways on virtually no volume.

Both sides of this trade, long and short, were presented with golden opportunities throughout this morning. Both sides chose not to act. Why?

#Gamma Squeezes

In order to continue, and explain my thesis, I need to explain a bit about gamma squeezes. **I also think this will be helpful to many people, because there is a ton of misconception that spreads about how gamma squeezes work.**

Gamma squeezes are a result of open interest in options and hedging by the market makers holding the options. People also misinterpret volume as open interest. Volume on options is for the most part irrelevant. What matters is how many total calls are open at each strike price. When a market makers sells a call option, they must remain risk neutral. In order to do so they need to buy shares of the underlying stock as the call becomes more likely to expire in the money. In a very simplistic form: let's say there is currently a 50% chance a 230c ends up in the money at the end of the week. The market maker would buy 50 shares now to hedge their risk. As it becomes more or less likely through price movement and theta decay, they'll either sell or buy more shares to remain risk neutral.

This leads us to the most common misinformation I see spread here and other places regarding gamma squeezes. *There are currently 250,000 calls ITM, so if we hold above this by Friday there will be a gamma squeeze.* That is not how it works. The strike prices that are currently in the money are probably considered 90+% likely to be in the money upon expiration, which means they are pretty much fully hedged already. They do not remain naked on all calls and then scrambled at close on Friday to fulfill ITM contracts.

So what causes a gamma squeeze? (This part is very important, and is the key to my entire thesis for Friday)

A large amount of open interest becoming ITM suddenly, unexpectedly, and very close to expiration. A gamma squeeze is essentially market makers scrambling to accumulate shares to fulfill contracts that are in the money. The only scenario in which this happens is for very unexpected price movement to happen on Friday basically.

#My Thesis

Short positions do not want the price to drop between now and market open on Friday. Longs want to have the highest possible number of OTM call options when markets open on Friday. Why? We need a large amount of open interest to move from OTM to ITM suddenly, unexpectedly and close to expiration so there is a smaller window for MM to fulfill the shares.

If we can get down under $150 by Friday open, this gives us several strike prices in $10 increments, many of which have large open interest amounts. These strike prices can be used fairly rapidly to force unexpected need for hedging risk (aka buying shares) very quickly. If we end up opening at $250+ on Friday? Most open interest that can realistically end ITM will already be ITM and thus already fully hedged against. This means there is little to no opportunity to force a gamma squeeze. Not only does open interest go against us, but we'd need to move the price up $50 to hit the next large batch of open interest, and then another $50 to the next, then after $400 it goes in $100 increments. *Additionally*, it takes an exorbitant amount of money to move the price from $250-300. It takes MUCH less to move it from $150-160. Then $160-170. And so on. And along the way you're picking up more and more buying pressure from MM hedging.

An added bonus to keeping the price lower is it will increase the open interest in FDs by lowering the premiums at strike prices between 150-250ish, which is where we really need the most open interest. 

#Conclusion

Short positions desperately do not want the price to drop too much before Friday. The squeeze needs an explosive movement to trigger, and if we get down to around $150-160 before open on Friday, it will take a significantly lower amount of capital and volume to trigger a large move.

Long positions want to see as low of a base as possible going into Friday, because it will mean a larger amount of open interest that can be used as fuel for a gamma squeeze, which could trigger the short squeeze.

IMPORTANT: This is all my opinion. This also is not a guarantee. For starters, I could be wrong about literally everything - I am retarded after all. Secondly, long whales have planned big attacks on Fridays before and failed every time. They could fail again this week even if I'm right. The important part is that if you believe based on your research that the short interest is still over 100%, then this has to squeeze at some point. It doesn't have to happen Friday, but it does have to happen. At the end of the day, validate any DD you see on your own, do your own research, and make your own decisions.

*‚ÄúThe 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.‚Äù*

*""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""*

&#x200B;

Seems all good news but TBH WHO EVEN CARES?????? You think a company is really going to turn down business from a client if they deal somewhat with someone else? **News flash: companies, shareholders, boards, etc. like revenue. MONEY = GOOD.** You think UWMC is going to track down little old Sally's broker shop's internal dealings to find out they worked with RKT and then cut them loose to lose business? IMO this was done to get some press on how RKT is screwing brokers to paint RKT in a bad light since they got all the hype in their recent moon - **the fundamentals IMO have not changed one bit.**

&#x200B;

May I remind you the fundamentals on this stock are insane, see short synopsis -> 

*UWM recently went public with a valuation of 16B calculated at 9.5x using the companies estimated adjusted net income of the first nine months ended September 2020 which was 1.7B x 9.5 this is BEFORE their record breaking earnings in Q3 and Q4 numbers were considered.*

*In Q3 they closed 54.2B in closed loan volume with 3.18% margin which equals to 1.45B in net income. This is a money printing machine especially with low interest rates and a booming housing market. Pays a dividend at .40c/share, current yield is 3.6% at $10.88 you will be buying in at the floor after consolidating for weeks.*

*Q4 net was an over 800% increase from Q3*

This stock has hit so much resistance and refuses to go below the current price, even on a red day like today. Volume has been extremely low the past week or so and I believe any ramp up will mean a sharp increase in price. We all have been given a second chance to hop on board as this stock slowly rises (its a solid long term play) and then likely engages the thrusters as others catch on to the deal. The stock is literally sitting below the original SPAC price???? da fuck?

Additional bull points

* to be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indexes on March 22nd
* don't believe a random redditor? **Median price target is $12 - a > 30% increase at today's price.** And this is being conservative
* \>4% dividend yield at today's price

&#x200B;

But icy\_fighter what about short interest???? Honestly short interest does not play into my yolos since its a very finicky type of play but if that's your kink checkout [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6id0b/how\_uwmc\_can\_make\_us\_all\_rich\_friday\_do\_not\_waste/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6id0b/how_uwmc_can_make_us_all_rich_friday_do_not_waste/) where open and short interest is talked about.

&#x200B;

Again this is a fundamentally sound company who's price has been held down by exaggerated news - i.e. the mortgage wars. They kill it on earnings, they kill it on dividends, they kill it on long term outlook. 

*Positions: 7,850 shares @ \~8.40 average*

1) Recently reported excellent phase 2B results demonstrating substantial improvement in all biomarkers as well as clinical improvement. Most importantly cassava followed up with an open label trial examining 50 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer‚Äôs disease who at six months exhibited improvement from baseline values in both cognition and behavior. Although this Was not a placebo controlled trial, the fact that there was actual improvement at six months in both cognition and behavior was outstanding.

2) In addition SAVA will be examining the open label trial at the 12 month mark to see if the improved parameters continue. SAVA has already done adequate fundraising to meet all financial demands over the next 1 to 2 years. 

3) SAVA on the verge of acquiring breakthrough therapy designation which will probably result in a mild improvement in stock performance. 

4) The CEO has recognized the limitations of the small company and has already stated that he is interested in part partnering with a large bio Pharma company for marketing and other expertise. 

MY THOUGHTS:  SAVA is grossly under valued as multiple analyst have now established a price target of around $87 which represents a 80% improvement over the present price. Here to for this is been simply a retail-based trade and only recently has institutional investors began to appear. SAVA has substantial upside and warrants your careful consideration. 

PRICE TARGET: Price target short term is somewhere from $90-$110 and long-term presuming a large bio Pharma buyout would probably be in the range of greater than $150 per share.

No financial advice, I know shit about what I'm talking about and am long for AMC for disclosure.

So now the fun part:

We have heard a lot about Elliott-Waves over last few days and I just realized, that the AMC chart is acting in exact the way as described by Elliott. We have three impulsive waves, first is shortest, seconds is the most explosive one and third one should be pretty much the same as first one.

So if you look at the chart: [AMC 1h on Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nJRPn7cv/) you will see that I have added the second correction and the third wave pretty much in the size of those before. Prediction goes to \~16.50 USD this friday. I think this is a pretty realistic prediction as it can also be traded as a swing trade with EMA50.

I have no idea what will happen after we reach my target but if you ask me, I would say that there's a good chance that we will see further breakouts upward.

TL;DR: There's a pretty good chance that we will hit at least \~16.50 USD by Friday.

Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.

**$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.

[$AMC, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING - Price goes UP](https://preview.redd.it/8cxvnms99mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b117cb869ad073ba1fdb3cc922b70461959c46d3)

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**  
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**

We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!

**12:31 Update**

My posts keep getting removed from the megathread so I've created a post to see if that stays up. If this doesn't work, I'll stay where I was at. Send me a message if you see this disappear.

Thank you all for your help! I didn't leave WSB on purpose, automod just doesn't like me.

Current price: 223.61

**12:26 Update**

GME did break 220 again and has been hanging around 222. We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at.

Current price: 224.04

**11:31 Update**

Thank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing.

I'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors.

GME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving?

Current price: 218.85

**11:08 Update**

Two small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now.

Current price: 215.96

**10:40 Update** 

Another attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket.

Current price: 214.00

**10:16 Update**

We're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub.

The attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory.

Current price: 220.96

**10:08 Update**

This isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in ü§∑.

They could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer.

I'll look closer and keep y'all updated.

Current price: 220.00

**10:03 Update**

GME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite.

Current price: 219.14

**9:41 Update**

After a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum. If GME can hit a Gamma Squeeze threshold, today could be insane.

Where's that threshold? I'm sure there are some wrinkle brains here that can figure that out for me. If y'all can give me the proof, I'll post it here.

**Corno4825, what happened? Why weren't you on WSB?**

I thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.

**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**

My fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.

When I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.

I am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.

**Corno4825, what did you learn?**

SHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.

That was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.

There are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.

**Corno4825, what does this mean?**

* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.
* The SHITs are running out of ammo.
* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.
* Earnings report is coming next week.
* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.
* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?",1616027610.0

I'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. 

I've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.

For example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:

[https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)

What bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.

Is it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. 

As far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.

I mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.

And no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)

TL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.",1616026230.0

Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-palantir-ceo-alex-karp/vi-BB19Aen1) where he mentions Apollo:

> We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.

As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:

> deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack. 

And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization: 

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

------

#Apollo

So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379). The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:

Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider. 

Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts. 

Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments. 

Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.

As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt. 

Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private. 

**Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly. 

Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.   

----

#Implications

In the Apollo article, it ends with:

>  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet. 

This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws. 

Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined. 

Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.

These are all great choices to pick for the long term. Any airline stock will surge when air travel resumes like normal. Look how well they‚Äôre performing even during these times, imagine at full capacity with no restrictions?

So what? Everyone knows this, and there are plenty of other industries that are doing well with the vaccine news.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What if I told you there was a way to invest as if it‚Äôs pre-vaccine days?** We need to take a quick look to our northern neighbor (eh?)

Canada has a very slow vaccine rollout. When you look at the numbers its surprising how a country like Canada can have such a terrible vaccine plan.

‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccination campaign started on the same day in December as the United States ‚Ä¶ Canada now ranks about 40th in the world in per capita vaccinations.‚Äù

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-trudeau-idUSKBN2AI1CO](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-trudeau-idUSKBN2AI1CO)

For reference, The CDC reports 21.7% of the entire population has been vaccinated with at least one dose, and 11.8% of the population vaccinated fully. The percentage for people over 65 years old is 64.6% and 36.6% respectively.

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

In Canada 5.11% of the population has received at least one dose, and 1.51% of the population is fully vaccinated.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

The reason for the slow rollout is because Canada can‚Äôt produce the vaccine. They have to purchase it from other countries (see the Reuters article.)

They have yet to experience the surge we are seeing in airline stocks due to vaccinations, imagine when they reach 10% fully vaccinated? 30%? 50%?

This is great opportunity to maximize your investments in the final stages of Covid. If there is one guarantee, it‚Äôs that Canada will vaccine it‚Äôs citizens. They‚Äôre just lagging in the race.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE AND RESEARCH.

WSB does not want stocks with less than $1BN Market cap. That just leaves two airlines that I‚Äôll post below for the lazy.

&#x200B;

||Pre Covid Price|Lowest Price|Current Price|% Recovered|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Air Canada ($AC.TO)|\~51$|\~9$|\~28$|55%|
|WestJet (Owned by $ONEX)|\~86$|\~41$|\~79$|82%|

""Air Canada is the flag carrier and the largest airline of Canada by fleet size and passengers carried.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air\_Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada)

""WestJet provides scheduled and charter air service to more than 100 destinations in Canada, the United States, Europe, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It began as a low-cost alternative to the country's competing major airlines.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WestJet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WestJet)

Either one of these are great additions to your portfolio. In my opinion Air Canada is the safer play. There is no way Canada would let Air Canada go bankrupt.  They are in the process of acquiring the dying airline Air Transat. They are waiting on a decision from the European Commission to determine whether this would make Air Canada a monopoly. The Canadian government has already approved of this deal.

[https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/transat-ponders-plan-b-should-europe-reject-air-canada-takeover/142861.article](https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/transat-ponders-plan-b-should-europe-reject-air-canada-takeover/142861.article)

Air Canada will not disappear any time soon. They are Canada's flagship carrier. They will just wait out the restrictions and prepare for the surge in airfare afterwards.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The biggest case against a huge surge when restrictions are lifted is that the business class will be almost extinct. With the new online structure, there is little incentive to fly employees around. This is true, however I believe that general airfare will increase in cost just due to the fact that there will be high demand in the beginning. I don‚Äôt think that flying packed planes, even without business, will run for a loss. I also believe airlines are already thinking about ways to maximize earnings in the anticipated rush. There‚Äôs a whole new world of opportunity out there, especially with a once in a lifetime situation like corona (fingers crossed for no more global pandemics)

**TL;DR: Canada has only vaccinated 1% of it's population. Airlines have started making a comeback with all the vaccine news. Canada has yet to experience that surge. Canada has a flagship airline that is a very safe bet IMO.**",1616023390.0

THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post. 

**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. 

Summary: 

1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. 
2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. 
3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. 
4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. 
5. The ""Minimum Exposure Point"" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",1616017203.0

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

*****

> # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

> * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday‚Äôs trend and finished higher.

*****

> # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

> * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won‚Äôt overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January‚Äôs 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

> # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

> * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

> * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to ‚Äúa lot of people that don‚Äôt want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.‚Äù However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

*****

> # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday‚Äôs U.S.-China meeting

> * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan‚Äôs first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won‚Äôt deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

> * Reflecting Washington‚Äôs concern about the erosion of Hong Kong‚Äôs rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing‚Äôs ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America‚Äôs ‚Äúsinister intention to interfere in China‚Äôs internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China‚Äôs stability and development.‚Äù

*****

> # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

> * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won‚Äôt receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

694,UWMC Addendum Update,412,m6zdqu,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6zdqu/uwmc_addendum_update/,76,"UWMC Ultimatum Update

Hello apes. Before calling me a Cramer cronie or a shill bot - I am in on GME. I like the stock and will not sell until it reaches at least $42069. Obligatory üöÄüöÄ

Now to the meat: 

Detroit news published an article advising that UWMC ‚Äòmissed 80% of their brokers‚Äô. Meaning that by the addendum ultimatum on 3/15 they did not reach their target. Nevertheless, here is a breakdown as per the source about how many brokers are on board/declined/have yet to respond.

‚ÄúThe 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.‚Äù

And:

‚ÄúNot responding doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt commit ‚Äî we‚Äôre still in communication with those who haven‚Äôt accepted or some clients are out of town, and it would be a vastly poor assumption to think that all those who have yet to accept won‚Äôt accept,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""

Source: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/03/16/united-wholesale-mortgage-misses-broker-goal-feud-rocket-mortgage-fairway-independent/4715422001/


TL;DR: 65% of independent brokers are confirmed with signing the deal. 1200 have yet to decide but CEO believe more than 50% will (seems reasonable).

Position: 83 shares @ 8.89av (new to the game, don‚Äôt @ me).

Edit: not sure how 1200 have still to make up their mind but a 3/15 addendum date was set. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm bullish on UWMC üöÄ",1616013222.0

2) It provides a great entry point for overextended/hyperinflated stocks that autists are too cautious about entering at PE ratios longer than the fake number my wife gave me for her ‚Äòweekend trip to Cancun with her friends‚Äô - which means people buy the fucking dip and start propping up the market again like a crowdsurfing white girl at a Fleetwood Mac concert.

The FINRA GME SHORT INTEREST report has been issued on MAR-9-2021. The settlement date of the report is FEB-26-2021 and does not include the short selling volume to date of FEB-26-2021.

Here we can use the mathematical calculation to calculate the SI of GME.

The FINRA SI of GME is 52.04% by the end of FEB-26-2021.(THIS DATA IS REPORTED BY THE HFs THEMSELVES, THEY WILL SURELY CHEAT AND WILL ONLY BE FINED FOR THAT)

1. The FINRA report is as follows:

The FINRA report is updated every semimonthly, and the updated data are summarized by FINRA and published in the following 8-9 days.

[http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

2. Here comes the calculation

The latest FINRA report shows that the top 10 institutions hold 140.70 M, TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP accounting for about 201.73% of the total equity of GME. (LOOK!!! THERE ARE MORE THAN 10 INSTITUTIONS!!! EVEN MAYBE 100 OR 1000)

The GME held by the top 10 funds is about 23.35M, TOTAL FUND HOLDING accounting for 33.48% of the total equity of GME. (AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)

As suggested by [desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/), RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.

The total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)

(140.70 M-26.21M) + (23.35M-9M) = 128.24 M

GME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;

GME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;

Q: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?

Synthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.

The total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:

128.24M ‚Äì 70 M = 58.24 M

The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:

Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float share \* 100%

Bring in data:

Float Short Interest = 58.24 M / 47M \* 100% = 123.91%

This means that at least 1.2 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO POINT OUT ANY MISTAKES THAT I MADE, I AM WILLING TO MAKE ANY EDIT.

EDIT 1: ([desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/))

RC Ventures is Ryan Cohen, new board member and is an insider. Shouldn‚Äôt be counted as institution. Possible double count, as the other board members don‚Äôt own that much. Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.

EDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https://www.reddit.com/user/dontkillchris/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating. The other stocks like AM-C don't have such problems.

EDIT 3: I found I can't reply to all of your comments, so I can only edit my post here. Is it because my account is quite new and has certain restriction?

EDIT 4:([bakebakingbaked](https://www.reddit.com/user/bakebakingbaked/)) But also doesn‚Äôt take ETFs into consideration-------Yes, maybe not included, so I say it's at least 180% !

EDIT 5:([AlexCormier1144](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexCormier1144/))Hey Zach. Thanks for the DD. Where did you get the 40 M from? How accurate is that number? Depending how accurate it is it could swing the SI by a good margin. Cheers!--------The 40M data is what I got by chance here in Reddit, look at the figure that shows the reddit website, but I lost track of the original post.

EDIT 6: I am in ASIA now, so due to the time difference I will not be able to reply you in time. My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!

EDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as ""shorting"".

EDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomadic8893/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!

EDIT 9ÔºöMy account has been ban for commenting (Weired)! Will create another new account TMR!

EDIT10ÔºöPosition figure removed.

EDIT11: IN ORDER TO DELETE THE REPEATED COUNTED SHARES, I WILL ONLY USE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDS DATA FOR CALCULATION. AGAIN, THIS ONLY PROVIDES A THOUGHT FOR CALCULATION, THE FINAL SI IS SO DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT12: I CAN'T CHANGE THE TITLE, IF POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT AS ""180% SHORT VOLUME"" WHICH IS STILL GOD DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT 13: THIS ACCOUNT CAN NO LONGER REPLY THE COMMENTS, FIND ME @[u/ZACK0806cool](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZACK0806cool/) THIS ACCOUNT WILL MAKE FURTHER EDITS AND I WILL TRY TO POST THIS REFINED VERSION THROUGH THAT NEW ACCOUNT!

EDIT 14:Fidelity is listed 3 times. Fidelity m&r co Llc, fidelity m&r, fmr Llc. If FMR close their positions, there might be someone else take over their positions, so I just remain part of the shares. ",1616009211.0

The stock currently trades at near all time low (83$) as of typing this. Trading started back in dec 2020 at 42$ IPO price valuation (Lockup until June 2021) and it did shoot up to 170$+ before the recent dumping along with tech stocks.

Artificial intelligence industry is massive and expected to grow. The total addressable market for artificial intelligence was a massive $40B in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.2% reaching $737.7B by 2027. To put AI in comparison with PLTR, AI currently sits at 8.3B marketcap while PLTR is circa 46.6B.

Recently, AI & Infor formed a partnership: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html) which will expose AI to massive amount of new customers. It is worth to note that current AI customers are few. However, they are huge and every contract is worth millions ex. Baker Hughes. Basically, every new customer at AI brings in massive growth and revenue. I expect this partnership to accelerate AI's revenue and open up for new streams.

Another worth mention point is that AI have also worked with Raytheon on an aircraft readiness program with U.S. Army Aviation, potentially leading the door to other high-profile public sector engagements.

There has been recent insider trade activity which was mainly selling at 85-95$ range which I think provided a very good entry for new traders. Note analysts have this stock as Hold, see some of these analysts targets: Piper Sandler > Overweight 141$ Canaccord Genuity > Hold 120$ Needham & Company > Buy 195$

It is hard to chart a recently traded stock but I believe AI stock is trading at a critical support level in which if breaks will provide unique opportunity to accumulate (IF). It is best to enter this stock with dollar cost average strategy in place so if you end up buying at the current level, make sure to keep some buying power in case we go to the 70s range.

For me, this will be one of the best risk to reward ratio printers if tech stocks reverse back up. You can check TradingView [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/) and see that your entry will be lesser than most other traders (Most bought in the 90s and 100s range) but please DYOR as usual and only trade what you can afford to lose, best of luck üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ.",1615999033.0

BackgroundIt's space stock trading at a market cap \~$3B with >$1.7B in yearly revenue and $0.3B net profit ,2020 got hit really hard after a series of bad situations which was pretty much the perfect storm: downturn in large satellite contracts, short sell attack, high debt, potential dividend elimination, satellite failure, trouble in liquidating part of business (GEO), transition from Canadian to US based forcing big Canadian holders to sell.

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $45 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors.

The Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.

**Edit:** To all you tin foil hat people, I'm not a fucking shill or whatever. I lurk on reddit and work as a software engineer at a FAANG. I just like this shit.

Also, if something in here is stupid, tell me why please I'd like to learn and do the opposite of confirmation bias.

By now we all know what a gamma squeeze is, and generally speaking we know the conditions under which it occurs. This post is intended to very ignorantly explore the degree to which $UWMC might be squozed.

# Hypothetical example:

Take the following example given the following assumptions:

There is only one institution making $UWMC's market

* This market maker only hedges their positions using derivatives of $UWMC and the underlying itself
* The MM is currently delta-neutral

Some Ape decides to buy some calls.

To be delta neutral after selling a call option, a market maker must own a certain number of shares equalling:  **Number of Contracts \* Delta \* 100.**

That is to say, if MM sells 10 OTM calls at time X with a 0.1 delta, they must buy 10 \* .1 \* 100 = 100 shares to be delta-neutral.

If the share price increases over time X + T such that those calls are now deep ITM, **and** the MM is still delta neutral **and** no other options activity took place, somewhere between time X and time T, the market maker must have necessarily purchased 900 additional shares.

It follows then, that the effect a market maker will have on price due to delta hedging is inversely related to the ratio of volume/float. **Simply put,** delta hedging has more of an effect on low-float, lower-liquidity names.

&#x200B;

**OK, where is the ape math for UWMC?**

Here it is:

What if UWMC were to hit $9? A potentially cascading effect:

The $9 and $10 calls would have a delta of \~53, and \~25 respectively, requiring MM's to purchase:

16,765 \* (.53-.34) \* 100 = 318,535 shares to be hedged on the $9's

38,823 \* (.25-.13) \* 100 = 465,875 shares to be hedged on the $10's

.... ect for the rest but I don't want to do the math. The number is bigger than 1M obvs. Someone else can do the math there's probly a tool for it but im hungry af and need to sleep. Multiply this by 3 and thats the MM hedging requirements for the next 3 options expiries. Delta curve its not the same but good enough for ape math. If it starts running it could go for a while, or it might not get enough steam.

Volume has been between average of 7M for the last 10 days, with a public float of 90M.

~~The potential is definitely there.~~ Is this enough for a gamma squeeze soon? IDK someone smarter than me tell me.  I also like UWMC as a mortgage company because of the way they are. Pics below for reference.

708,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,0,m6u2km,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6u2km/why_uwmc_is_no_match_for_rkt_in_the_long_term/,31,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Not financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",1615991603.0

712,In a world full of overvalued inflated stocks.....Alibaba is a diamond in a rough,53,m6sv8z,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6sv8z/in_a_world_full_of_overvalued_inflated/,134,"Hello fellow autists,

I am presenting an opportunity that has risk but the rewards are much lucrative. Alibaba (BABA) is a severely undervalued tech stock that serves over 1 billion people. **BILLION.** Lately Alibaba has had a barrel of bad news but every analyst and hedge fund on the street agrees on one thing...it is a premier undervalued blue chip tech stock. Nowadays where you fuckers throw 30% OTM calls at all sorts of stuff even though the stock is at 52 week highs. Well I am presenting you a diamond in the rough that also happens to be a mega cap. 

**What is Alibaba?**

 Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group and as Alibaba.com, is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. The company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. **To summarize it is the Chinese Amazon (AMZN) and does all sorts of things.**

**Alibaba is a great company with great growth prospects but you don't need me to tell you that just look at the numbers.**

 \-Alibaba‚Äôs e-revenue for 2020 was $41.7 billion

\- The latest available info shows that the Alibaba Group held 55.9% of the Chinese ecommerce market

\- In Q3 2020, the percentage of profits that Alibaba generated just from commerce in China was 62%. 

\- Alibaba‚Äôs GMV on Singles‚Äô Day in 2020 reached $74.1 billion.

\-**THE PE RATIO IS 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE for a super growth company**

With a five-year annualized¬† earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.

Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.

The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.

Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's **cloud-computing business** is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.

Alibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.

Sales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's video streaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.

**Why buy Alibaba right now? They have got butt fucked raw the past few months by the Chinese government? Most recently the Chinese government told Alibaba to dump their media assets.**  

The risk is simple, will the Chinese government continue to make investors uneasy and weigh on Alibaba. They just told them to dump their media assets.... which weirdly enough would be bullish.  An analyst at Morgan Stanley made the case that it would be a positive for Alibaba to do so, as it would improve its margins and provide it with more capital. Their media assets lose them money. The analyst reiterated the firm's overweight rating and $320 price target. **It has only been negative news lately and you must buy when others are fearful.** 

I am a capitalist loving spitfuck, I am no commie. If you want capitalism to thrive throw some money into this strong fundamental company.

**What is the play and why now?**

**May 21 240 Calls** 

The stock has gotten wrecked and has showed stabilization. This is a great opportunity to enter in and ride it to tendie town. Worst case scenario it breaks 220 support and you eat the losses. Best case scenario it skyrockets leading up to earnings in May and you cash out for great gains. It will by no means be an easy diamond hands. This stock moves very crazily, I am currently down 9% on my calls. But when IV picks back up and it skyrockets we will be driving lambos. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

On my etrade research all the analysts have price targets of 285+, average target of 325, and highest being 395. And those guys get paid a lot more than I do to do research.

Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it.
This was done at 11Am, March 16th.

TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI. 

GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday. 

My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19. 

What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK. 
You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone. Whoever the good hedge is, or the whale, who is fighting for us, will act at some point, and it will be obvious to anyone watching MACD and order books.

Hello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the ""case study"" below.

I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.

I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.

Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. 

Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...

1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company‚Äôs competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company‚Äôs new motto: ‚Äú**The Platform for Amazing Things**.‚Äù
2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""

Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.

Am I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?  Good or bad, let me hear it.",1615985040.0

They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. 

They tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attacking day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it‚Äôs because of the good intent in this sub that helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. 

I mean, I know the cliche of ‚Äúnever trust the news,etc‚Äù but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can‚Äôt see it by now you‚Äôre obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they‚Äôll just change up the rules to punish the ‚Äúlittle guys‚Äù. It really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor. 

You honestly couldn‚Äôt write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls. A fucking store that buys and sells used video games. A dude that seems like he‚Äôd make Keanu Reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit exposed them; but not because he wanted to fuck them over, but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol.

Reposting to WSB because, well honestly, you give better feedback than GME sub.

I am new to investing, but I am trying to determine my own ""fair market value"" for one share of GME, assuming after the squeeze gets squoze, and **after** all the short-interest and dust settles, where would a company, such as GameStop, likely trade at based on a mildly optimistic **future outlook** (3-5 years)?

Just remember the vision that R.C. has discussed in writings to GameStop, and the future strategic goals he hopes to achieve.

&#x200B;

I think the safest **industry(s)** we can assume, given the ""digital-first"" strategy would be:

\- E-Commerce (Online Retail) 125B Avg Mkt Cap, PE 129.05, Exp growth **20.17%**

\- Retail (Distributor) 27B PE 21.91, Exp growth **10%**

\- Software (Entertainment), 44b,  PE 109.44, Exp growth **19.72%**

\- Gaming Industry 47B, PE  27, Exp growth **12%**

&#x200B;

**Similar Industry/Potential Competition:**

Best Buy (28.6B / 16 PE),

Target (89.5B / 21 PE),

Amazon (1.54T / 74 PE),

Netflix (226B / 85 PE),

Steam/Valve (62.46B),

Overstock(?), Walmart(?)

&#x200B;

**Pros**

\+ E-commerce retail, expanding reach in current markets (US/CA/AUS/EU)

\+ Consolidate physical stores, Free Up Cash for next cycle.

\+ In-Store Entertainment (VR / Lan / Tournament hosting etc)

\+ Multi-Channel Distribution (Gaming PCs, Video Games, Streaming (P))

\+ Brand Awareness / Expanded (free!) publicity

\+ 60m+ Power-Up Reward subscription service

\+ Same-day delivery of Video Games/PC Hardware from existing locations ^((credit both)

[^(SomeGuyNamedPaul)](https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeGuyNamedPaul/) ^(/) [^(Iam\_nameless)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iam_nameless/) ^(from previous post))

\+ (Possible) Streaming Service

\+ (Possible) In-Store Entertainment, Kids and Adults

\+ (Possible) P2P Marketplace??

\+ (Possible) Capture microtransaction market

\+ (Possible) Esports brand/ Streaming

\+ (Possible) Ad revenue on their streaming service etc. (\~30B gaming ad rev)

\+ (Possible) On-Demand Gaming platform

&#x200B;

**Cons**

\- Past performance

\- Lower demand for physical games (\~15-17%)

\-  About 80% of total Video Games revenue (200B) came from F2P Microtransactions in 2018

What's the worst that can happen right?

I just want to know what a share of GME should be worth, using a future-looking fundamental approach to an evolving/pivoting business, and what the ""generally expected"" price would be if everything goes ""according to plan"" (given 80-90% success probably, for instance).

&#x200B;

**Anything you guys wanna add/remove** let me know, I will soon add some Industry data and revenue projections as soon as I research and write it all down..

# Thanks to everyone providing their feedback so far.

# Looks like my next steps are to dig into competitor businesses for profit margin data, determine the financial impact the initial pivot strategies.

# The March 23 Earnings Call should hopefully provide an overview of the business strategy moving forward, and I should have more related financial/sector data ready at that time.

# Thanks to allüíéü¶ç and üåàüêª out there.... TO THE MOON!!!!!üöÄ

\*This is not financial advice, I started investing 4 months ago. I own GameStop stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Update\*\*

Anyways, if anyone's interested I figured the **most** **conservative value I would value Gamestop** would be **$291.85** (factors in the post-hype post-squeeze).

This predicates on my theory they can generate 1b net profit in the first 1-2 Years, given the unprecedented demand and I believe streaming will play a vital role, like Twitch.  Essentially I see them as the potential ""Amazon of Gaming"", having their hands across multiple sectors.

I predict they won't just ease into the market, they will DISRUPT it.

Other competitors playing around in the gaming industry won't be able to compete, there will be massive return from retail investors, whether they previously gamers or not.

&#x200B;

Opportunities:

\-**Hit the ground Running with strategic locations, (In-store Streamed Events??)**

\-H**yper-growth ecommerce shift**

\-**Gaming PCs in higher demand.**

\-C**apture microtransaction market by,**

\-Large audience shift to Gamestop brand **over** competitors, for same products.

\-Resurgence of audience demanding of new Gaming Content and Live INTERACTION!!

&#x200B;

So, **at least 1B annual revenue in next 1 to 2 yrs,**

and a, *very conservative*, **30 PE (based on related industry averages weighted by profit estimates by sector).**

...then I gave the whole ""successful rebrand"" thing an **82% chance** of happening (lol idk, take it or leave it).

So yeah, **$291.85**, super conservative, this would be my floor essentially.

# Realistically, I am calculating that it should naturally hover anywhere from $300-$500, (much potential, wide range)  assuming constant number of shares, ofc.

**So what does this mean for friday 03/19?**

Every GME stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies day and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on.

Every GME Stock price above 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters. So I guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday: to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$.

Every GME Stock price below 150 $ on 03/19 will end in... well... So many PUTS then in the money, this will end really bad for the stock price and shorters will make a lot of money to reload their shorting ammo.

&#x200B;

**\*\*TLDR:\*\***

GME above 300 $ on friday: Start to Valhalla from friday on.

GME above \~170$ on friday, Calls will still win, GME will rise more.

Anything below 150$ on friday: Here we go again, 40$ GME.

So it's very important this week that we and the long wales are able to keep the stock price >170$.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Regarding Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls:

The huge amounts of new 800c Calls last week didn't help us because it was way out of the money for the Marketmakers, so they didn't see a reason to cover those calls. Stock price was \~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money.

First and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips. I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.

Have you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.

Think about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?

The little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair ""stock"" market and that anyone can become rich.

I'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.

The thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.

But seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?

Hint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING

No matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.

**Next my fellow retards,**

HDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.

No time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever üôåüôåüôå

Remember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.

My blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.

I can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.

TO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO. GAMESTOP WILL BE THERE.

So I listened to you monkes and bought RKT.
Then I listened again and bought some UWMC.

Now UWMC is sitting low right now, and expectations are plain that it‚Äôll recover with magnificent green for anyone HODLing like a good boy. And UWMC is coming out of the RKT little trade dispute claiming victory. And their graph looks promising, since the expectation is it‚Äôll go back up, then keep growing because why wouldn‚Äôt it? Unless their ultimatum doesn‚Äôt pan out how they hoped it would?

But RKT isn‚Äôt just going to go out of business. Their stock price is lowish, and maybe they lost some market share to UWMC after that ultimatum. But odds are they‚Äôll recover; or at least won‚Äôt go broke immediately. They don‚Äôt announce their next earnings until May, so we won‚Äôt know for sure how this pans out for a little while. But here‚Äôs the thing. As of a week ago, with the previous earnings report, RKT has an EPS higher than the price. That gives it a P/E of <1 as of writing. And that means it *should* go up.

Look at any other stock. Their P/E, specifically. You‚Äôll see 10, 20, 50. Bought TSLA? That‚Äôs 1000x P/E. That means that the stock price is that many *times* higher than that percentage of the company is profitable. Higher P/E values are irrational, and represent investors expecting the company to grow to meet that number. Except for insane stocks like TSLA, because growing that much is impossible. But big numbers are fun, and TSLA attracts the nuts, so fine. TSLA is a rollercoaster. Just, perhaps, a rickety one.

Now look at UWMC. Their P/E is 0, because their EPS is negative. They are losing money, they are unprofitable. This is not a good thing for a company to be. Without outside assistance or major internal change, they‚Äôll run out of money eventually and go out of business. Unless they‚Äôre a growth stock in a new company, in which case those negative earnings represent the ‚Äústart up time‚Äù; getting the ball rolling costs; once it gets going, it pays off. And guess what, UWMC *is* growing, so hey there might be something to that.

But RKT? They are objectively undervalued. And while the stock market is generally understood to be irrational, it will, occasionally, pass through the rational values to get to other irrational values. Moreover, it‚Äôs generally irrational *up*, not *down*.

Point is, UWMC should go up because it‚Äôs a growing company, and may *hopefully soon* become profitable.

Meanwhile, RKT should also go up, because it is *actually* profitable *and* undervalued right now.

So *why not both*?

Elliot Wave Theory

Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

As you can see, our fellow ü¶ç Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064

Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf

Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. ü§Ø I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

So you are telling me that fellow ü¶ç Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first üöÄ launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

&#x200B;

Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January 

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our üöÄ finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec

What actually happened after that ""prediction""?

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our üöÄ take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f

Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b

üöÄ Pre-Launch

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few üìÑ üôå bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our üöÄ fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the üöÄ take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",1615972576.0

Zomedica is an animal health company focused on meeting the needs of clinical veterinarians in ways that promote both patient and practice health. Our mission is to advance the effectiveness and financial well-being of veterinary practitioners by delivering professionally beneficial diagnostic products and services.

*Disclaimer: I¬¥m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

**TRUFORMA main product and homerun winner:**

Truforma is a point-of-care device meant to deliver testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Truforma uses ""Bulk Acoustic Wave"" (BAW) technology which they claim provides accurate and repeatable test results. It offers complete control over the testing process from start to finish, with highly sensitive and specific immunoassays that allow veterinarians to make clinical decisions faster.

The immunoassays deliver accurate, reliable data when testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Assay performance metrics to determine specificity and sensitivity were determined with the goal of meeting or exceeding the stringent testing standards found in a reference lab setting.  

The process on how to use it is simple:

1) Obtain a Sample

2) Add the Sample to the Cartridge

3) Insert the Cartridge into Truforma

4) Results will be provided in 20 minutes or less on average.

**Zomedica Announces First Commercial Sale of Its Truforma¬Æ Platform:**

The first official purchaser of a TRUFORMA¬Æ system was Jason Berg, DVM, DACVIM, founder and president of Guardian Veterinary Specialists, a 29,000-square-foot advanced emergency critical care and specialty hospital in Brewster, New York.

Dr. Berg commented that ‚ÄúAs a veterinary internist and business owner, I have devoted myself to advancing the practice of veterinary internal medicine and delivering care with a difference ‚Äì doing more, providing more, and caring more. I am excited to be the first veterinarian to purchase TRUFORMA¬Æ. I will be able to go above and beyond the current standard of care to provide cutting-edge and novel testing to pet owners and veterinarians in seven surrounding counties across two states.

**My opinion on this:**

Potential competitors include large veterinary diagnosis companies, small businesses focused on animal health, reference laboratory services provided by academic institutions, and in-clinic products providers. Some of these are Idexx Laboratories Inc., Antech Diagnostics, Abaxis Inc., just to name a few. These are way bigger and although they don‚Äôt have something like Truforma, they have the assets to compete and maybe win. 

Having said this, I predict two outcomes, one is that the company will have a nice growth in the short term, with nice profit potential but not a good long term. If this gets bought by one of its competitors, then we can see a massive price increase on the stock. Why do I think this can get bought? It¬¥s cheaper for the competition to buy than to develop. Idexx currently has over a 43B market cap.

Also, if the first buyer bought one unit for a 29,000-square-foot, then I don¬¥t know how many units might be sold.

I¬¥m betting on this for the short term, with this cutting-edge technology, my price target is at 4.6, about a 100% upside.

Here‚Äôs my update after today‚Äôs fuckery. 

Real quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that‚Äôs what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I‚Äôm doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best/expect the worst. This is why I‚Äôm hype, take it or leave it. I also don‚Äôt have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.

First, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That‚Äôs the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I‚Äôm sitting there getting pissed off because it‚Äôs like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell‚Äôs D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn‚Äôt help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn‚Äôt know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.

The whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It‚Äôs comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It‚Äôs like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. 

Here‚Äôs my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we‚Äôre not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don‚Äôt think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That‚Äôs my hope. Today‚Äôs sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won‚Äôt. 

If RKT can bounce back above 26 then we‚Äôre right back in the game. Again, there really weren‚Äôt many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. 

If the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That‚Äôs the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. 

Let‚Äôs finish the week off positively. We‚Äôre in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it‚Äôs undervalued as shit.",1615970464.0

I know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. 

AMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. 

Hating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single ""retail investor"" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win/squeeze, the entire economy/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

 Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. 

To me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. 

So support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME.

747,Can the MMs and HFs keep artificially increasing GME float (synthetic shares) to keep kicking the short-squeeze down the road?,90,m6njm8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6njm8/can_the_mms_and_hfs_keep_artificially_increasing/,94,"Not a financial or legal advisor.  Honest question.

I'm a pretty sophisticated ape.  Unless I am missing something, the only way for 106.46% of float to be held by Institutions and 21.88% of the float to be held by Insiders (data courtesy of Trade-Ideas) is if some of the shares held long are synthetic shares.  How is that even possible (rhetorical question)?  My understanding is synthetic shares are used to ensure liquidity in the options market; but the I.O.U's are supposed to be settled with actual shares if an option is exercised.  Rather than spend hours studying the regs, I will just assume either (1) the rules do not impose a sufficient amount of audit/reconciliation requirements; or (2) rules are being broken.

Either way, it seems the MMs and HFs have been able to ""create"" synthetic shares, which are then sold and purchased ""long"" in the market.  Apart from confirming how rigged and fucked up the system is; can't they just keep this game up forever?  In other words, can't they just purchase a bunch of in-the-money call options and exercise them to ""buy back"" the shares and return them to the lender? There is a theory that is what the hedgies tried to do last week in their short ladder attack (and that it was actually the Hedgies that had purchased the $300 and $325 call options; and, that it was the long whales who prevented the price from being $300 last Friday so the hedgies could not exercise their options as they are running out of shares held long).

BTW: I am bullish on GME and have a large position.  So certainly not to rain on anyone's parade.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* My karma is too low to respond to comments.  I get the data out there is different on what the % held by institutions actually is.  But the question remains that the amount of shares held long > the float.

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I am a big time technical trader.  The stock certainly is not behaving normally.  It is constantly being manipulated (hence the dive on extremely low volume pre-market this morning, which induced a minor panic sell).  The fact that so much manipulation is going on of the stock price tells me this story is far from over.

***Edit 3*** I understand how short selling works. I understand that brokers irresponsibly lend out the same share multiple times. But before we even get to what the ""true"" short float is, we have institutional+insider+retail who hold > 100% of the float. That alone should cause the infinity squeeze (even if the short float were only 20%). But they keep finding shares to short....if they are not ""real"" shares, what are they? And if the same share is lent to shorts multiple times, the same share is owned long by multiple people. Yet the MMs still sold thousands of call options last week (hundreds of which were in the money). How can options even be sold if there are no shares available?",1615969404.0

Elliot Wave Theory

[ Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below... ](https://preview.redd.it/idm32ufg5hn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=9998fee714a9de34c57496decc0b0084514bcfd6)

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

https://reddit.com/link/m6mkl8/video/vsm22l8l5hn61/player

As you can see, our fellow ü¶ç Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"". Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. ü§Ø I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

#  So you are telling me that fellow ü¶ç Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first üöÄ launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https://preview.redd.it/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our üöÄ finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

[What actually happened after that \\""prediction\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our üöÄ take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

[üöÄ Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few üìÑ üôå bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our üöÄ fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the üöÄ take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.

In the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.

Well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.

In the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.

Short Interest is up:

Todays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)

**Shorts still in the game:**

As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.

During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

So the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

[DTCC Rule](https://preview.redd.it/sy0i9annvgn61.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f92e73f2ada0b0483aef46f515cd3c8494ca5b7)

**Housing data comes out March 17th:**

This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.

1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.
2. Employment is strengthening.
3. Economy is re-bounding.
4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.
5. Low rates continue.

**Open Call Options:**

Look at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.

https://preview.redd.it/c6ldqdcvvgn61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31c64985c5fc5c45a3c236a93d36a1ec39ce603

**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**

Stimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.

Triple witching:

Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.

Triple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell‚Äîcalled the ""triple witching hour""‚Äîcan result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

The housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links.... GL lol but it shows we are MOONING and so is the Housing market.

What does this mean for ROCKET?! Well it indicates that Rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term. The current price is such a fire sale it isn't even comparable to what we will see in 5-10 years from now.

Inflation is about to take place and we may see 5-10% increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this.

This is Bullish for Rocket and thats why I will be holding Rocket Long term.

**TLDR:**

761,If you still have doubts about the infamous ‚ÄùNaked Shortings‚Äù or ‚Äùhow can a stock have more shares than 100% of the outstanding float?‚Äù let me clear that out,228,m6ls2r,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ls2r/if_you_still_have_doubts_about_the_infamous_naked/,39,"**TR;LD:** Institutions uses Alternative Trading (ATs) mechanism called Traderbots (HFT, high -frequency trading algos) to insert large positions in the markets using dark pools (hidden positions). Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows ‚Äùnaked shorting‚Äù by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional ‚Äùnaked shorting‚Äù when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. 



**How does this happen?**


Alternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. 

The reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. 

At first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of ‚Äùblock transactions‚Äù around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as ‚Äù*toxic*‚Äù market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of ‚Äúblock transactions,‚Äù where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.

There is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.

_**Here is Barclay‚Äôs disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:

‚Äú*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, ‚Äú[n]one of which*,‚Äù recalled one Director, ‚Äú*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*‚Äù Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.

*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*


_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_

a) front-runs transactions, 

b)  void regulation, 

c)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), 

d) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, 

e) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),

f) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.

*Does that sounds familiar???*

A lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and ‚Äùtimes and sales‚Äù charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.

The author of the paper went a step forward saying that ‚ÄùATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.‚Äù

The idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. 

**How is this becomes illegal?**

‚ÄùIf dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.‚Äù

When a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it‚Äôs intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. ‚Äùnaked shorting‚Äù sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator‚Äôs books (not sent to NSCC/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It‚Äôs one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.

**Why is important to understand this?**


This process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every ‚Äùfail to deliver‚Äù the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.

If you having read it yet, [check this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)  from u/gafgarian

As long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market. It's a matter of who gets tired first.

Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don‚Äôt matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‚Äòoh no I got caught‚Äô fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I‚Äôve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let‚Äôs dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock‚Äôs total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel‚Äôs? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let‚Äôs see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‚Äòbest execution‚Äô for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn‚Äôt in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 ‚Äì August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC‚Äôs potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‚Äòsystem issue‚Äô which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I‚Äôm getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‚Äòoh X didn‚Äôt know, they‚Äôre not trained!‚Äô as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 ‚Äì August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 ‚Äì February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it‚Äôll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn‚Äôt give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

If you're still on that piece of trash platform you're essentially choosing to stay in an abusive relationship. RH showed in January that they either can't or won't support you during large market events. The reasons why don't even matter, they can't. 

Harken back to the Cuban AMA. Remember that? One of his foremost pieces of advice was to get a real broker with a trillion dollar balance sheet. Fidelity or Vanguard, pick one. Doesn't matter which they're both boomer hellscapes to interact with but they at least have your back.

Now do a partial account transfer. This is \*faster\* than a full account transfer and just transfers specific shares of your choosing. I did this and transferred my volatile shares to Fidelity and they were only in limbo for a day or two. Then I did my full account transfer separately, and that took about two weeks of which 4 days or so the shares were truly locked up.

If this seems too hard then maybe you should know that there is a non-zero chance RH may disable *selling* during the squeeze. Did you see that recent offering to give you cash for deposits? They're desperate for money and on their last legs. If anyone asks them for a big chunk of collateral they are instantly GOING TO FOLD AGAIN. It might sound harsh but if this happens and your shit is locked up and you can't sell, that's your own damn fault. It's been a month and a half that people have been screaming to get a real broker.
