10,Police Officer here: My thoughts on Pokemon Go.,38865,4t4q1c,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t4q1c/police_officer_here_my_thoughts_on_pokemon_go/,1889,"Not sure if there have been any other officers posting here. But I wanted to share a story about the game.

For starters, there are plenty of officers here on reddit that are playing the game. We love it. Heck, the Sheriffs Office in my county held an impromptu ""Pokemon GO"" day a few days ago. It was great. 

But tonight I saw something that really struck me. I work in a fairly small town. Not a whole lot of people around at nights, and there really is not a whole lot to do. Especially for kids and young adults. Tonight while I was working, I checked a nearby park, and opened up the game. I saw that someone placed a Lure module on a stop nearby. 

I drove to the stop. It is our town's veterans memorial. We have a wonderful, beautiful memorial in our downtown area to honor those that serve in our nation's military. Since it's a small town, the only time it ever gets visitors is on holidays, or during town festivals. Last night there were about 15 teenagers at this memorial. Obviously because of the Lure Module. 

But what amazed me, what made me so happy that this game exists, is how the teens acted. They weren't rowdy or obnoxious. They respected the memorial. Not only that, but they actually took time and walked around it. They looked at the names engraved, admired the sculptures, all while waiting for pokemon to show up. 

These teens never would have come out and visited the Veterans memorial had it not been for this game. So thank you. 

#TeamHarmony

Couple quick edits:

A couple people have asked why I added in that I was a Police Officer when it didn't have much to add. At first I was going to also mention how calls of suspicious activity have been on the increase, and how it seems like undesirables hanging around parks seems to have decreased. In addition community relations with the younger crowd have really improved. Its way easier to talk with them and they feel far more comfortable with me around knowing that I have similar interests. 

Secondly, I also understand I may have worded my post wrong when saying I was surprised they weren't being obnoxious or rowdy. Usually, when a group of teens is hanging around a park or monument at 10, 11, 12 at night, it isn't for a good reason. They are usually (read not all the time however most of the time) either vandalizing the area, smoking dope, drinking, or banging in a car. Why else would someone go to a park that late at night? As such, I was happy to see that they were doing something positive, and enjoying a nice Friday night. 

Thank you everyone for your replies, and I am sorry if I did not get to your reply. I went to sleep immediately after the post, and I had 500+ messages when I woke up. Thank you all, continue to enjoy this awesome game, and stay safe!",1468707601.0

So, that means we need to call them directly. 1-855-836-3987. Such a removal is most likely temporary.

**EDIT-** make sure to respond to Google's email after you file your complaint! The lovely comment in the below edit explains how!

**EDIT-** some [great step by step instructions were posted in a comment.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4vj0ir/niantics_refusal_to_accept_support_emails_is_a/d5yswnf) Make sure to check it out!

As you guys may know, Android/Google Play has a refund policy of crediting purchases from only the last 48 hours. After that you must contact the developer for a refund. However, Niantic's listed email address just gets you an auto-response stating that they don't monitor the email. This is an overt violation of the terms and conditions of their Google Play agreement and (according to a Google Play supervisor I spoke to) could result in harsh penalties for Niantic if they don't change things.

So, it is our responsibility to force them to change. I suggest we all fill out the following reports of this violation and make Niantic listen to us!

Quite a few posts have been made stating that one easy way to do this would be to have a ""companion"" Pokemon that followed you around, such as happened in Yellow or the G/S remakes.  Now what if having a companion Pokemon had a special buff it would give you, based on it's type?  I came up with a few below, but I'm sure others will come up with better ones. 

* Flying = Bird's Eye View: The range which you can find Pokemon and touch Pokestops/gyms is increased.

* Fire = Incubation: Eggs gain distance at an increased rate.

* Grass = Sweet scent: You let off a pleasant smell which attracts nearby Pokemon (a weaker incense.)

* Normal = Pick up: Your Pokemon finds an item every x Km walked, anything from a potion to an incubator.

* Psychic = Premonition: Your radar displays what direction nearby Pokemon are in.

* Dragon = A Worthy Opponent: Nearby Pokemon have an increased CP.

* Electric = Supercharged: Pokestops can be activated more frequently.

* Fighting = Fighting spirit: You can collect gym rewards more frequently.

Pokemon with two types would have both powers at a reduced power (maybe 75%.)  But the real key to this is a new stat added to every Pokemon: Happiness.  As you walk with your companion or power them up, their happiness increases, which increases the power of their ability.  So a newly caught Pidgey might give +10% radius, but a max happiness Pidgey could give +20%.  Also, a Pokemon at max happiness can be powered up without candy (again, allowing you to build a connection to your companions.)  You should be able to change your companion with a decrease to happiness, and a 1 hour cooldown to prevent rapid cycling.  Just some ideas.

**Edit:If you want to know the CPs for 2000+ final evolutions just double the numbers listed.The website might not be 100% accurate.Use this list as an indication.For more accurate results refer to an IV calculator like https://pokeassistant.com/main/ivcalculator or the IV rater on https://thesilphroad.com/research .**

This list assumes that your pokemon has average IVs so if yours are below average then you should expect a little declination for your results.

**UPDATE (28/10)**

**UPDATE (13/10)**

Gonna start putting the latest updates at the top so that it's easier to read.

http://www.pidgeycalc.com/

**UPDATE! (03/08)**

- Fixed some bugs to do with Safari and private browsing
- Minor text fixes

**UPDATE (06/08)**

- Dropdown list is now categorised into candies required
- Output is now sorted in alphabetical order
- Pokemon with 0 transfers or 0 evolves are now not shown

**UPDATE (10/08)**

- Changed the dropdown list back to alphabetical order

**UPDATE (18/08)**

- Android app released. It costs 99c but it's completely ad free and works offline so no data consumption at all. iOS coming soon.
- Site still functioning as usual

**UPDATE (24/08)**

- Added a new tool - PidgeyAppraise - to help with figuring out what the appraisal messages in the game mean

**UPDATE (27/08)**

- Removed link to PidgeyAppraise, however you can still access it at http://www.pidgeycalc.com/appraise/
- iOS app finally up! Had to change the name to PC because apparently 'Pidgey' is misleadingly associating with Pokemon

**UPDATE (07/09)**

- Added a 'new Pokedex entry' section so you can account for new evolutions. This adds +1000 xp and +5 seconds
- Android and iOS updates will be up soon!

**FAQs**

- Remember that you get +1 candy per evolution!
- If you're experiencing any weirdness with buttons not working, try clearing your browser cache
- Pokemon are all independent, so it's recommended that you transfer all your second tier evolutions (Pidgeottos, etc.) first before using PidgeyCalc

**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Anything below here is for the old version ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**

I spent the day making this calculator while the servers were down. Just pop in the amount of Pidgeys and Pidgey candies you have and hit Calculate. *The calculator also accounts for the extra candies you get for each evolution.*

Time estimates are based on a conservative 30 seconds per evolution. This can vary depending on how well the server keeps up. I'll adjust this as the servers start to stabilise.

I worked through a few test cases on pen and paper and the maths was sound, but if you do find any errors, let me know.

If you're not sure what this is for, I've explained it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t9p6p/psa_use_this_pidgey_calculator_before_wasting/d5fmqqk).

**EDIT: Updated!**

 I've added a dropdown list to select between a few common Pokemon, including Rattata!

[Here's a new screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kLnFnZj.jpg)

I've also made a few QOL changes and bug fixes including a tip on whether or not to use the Lucky Egg and how many you should use. Negative amounts and super large amounts are also restricted. Thanks /u/Mule50.

Also, to those offering to contribute: I really appreciate all the offers but this is just a personal project of mine as I'm rather new to web development and learning through practice. I'm happy to accept help/suggestions here. Please contact me if you wish to use any of my code. Thanks! And thanks to whoever gilded me :D

Things that may be added in the future:

- Multiple Pokemon calculations
- Transfer of T2 Pokemon
- Custom Pokemon input

To manually calculate for multiple Pokemon, just do each individually and then add up the estimated time. If it's > 30 minutes you're good to go.

**Edit: To those wondering why the number of evolves is higher than simply Candies/12 - each evolution gives you back 1 Candy. So by the time you evolve 12 Pidgeys, you'll have enough extra Candies to evolve another one.**

**UPDATE 2 (19/07)**

**You can now do batch calculations!**

I've also added some QOL updates such as scrolling when you hit calculate and add.

Also, I've definitely read all the suggestions to add a reverse function that tells you how many Pokemon you'll need to utilise all your candies. This is something that may be implemented in the future, but for now, the magic numbers are 60 Pidgeys and 661 Candies.

**EDIT:**

Fixed some more bugs. Everything should be working fine now. If you find any bugs please send me a PM as I only check the comments in this thread occasionally. Cheers.

**UPDATE 3 (20/07)**

You can now add in any evolvable Pokemon you want! I've implemented a new searchable dropdown list using [Chosen](https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/). Let me know if you like this method better or prefer the old one. If you find any bugs, the best way to reach me is via PM. Thanks!

Edit: Search has been disabled on mobiles for now as it was buggy. Desktop still works.

**UPDATE 3.5 (20/07)**

To people from Germany and France: I've added browser-based language detection for the 9 common Pokemon in the list. Let me know if this isn't working properly so I can change it back!

- ~~Added an extra layer of location checking to make sure the user is actually from Germany/France instead of other German or French speaking countries.~~

**UPDATE 3.5.1 (21/07)**

All Pokemon have been translated to French and German. This is based off your browser language. Also included a link to the English names if you need them. Let me know if there are any typos.

**UPDATE 3.5.2 (22/07)**

Added to the recommendation section a basic recommendation telling the user how many more Pokemon they need to evolve if they haven't reached the 30 minute threshold.

**UPDATE 3.5.3 (22/07)**

The site should display properly on Firefox now. Sorry IE/Opera - haven't had time to fix the CSS issues just yet.

Also, if you're evolving two Pokemon from the same evolution chain, the amount of candies is independent. I'll fix this in a future version but for now just keep that in mind when entering candy amounts.

**UPDATE 3.6 (23/07)**

Japanese is now supported, however number input is a bit weird. Make sure you're doing keypresses and not autocomplete on mobile devices.

- Changed the input detection to detect changes instead of key presses. Don't know why I didn't make this change earlier.

- Made some adjustments to the UI so that the buttons aren't obstructed on smaller screens.

**UPDATE 4 (24/07)**

Since a lot of people have asked, I added a checkbox so the calculator now accounts for transfers after evolving! Yay! Just toggle it on/off before you hit Add or Calculate. If you're doing a batched calculation, you can toggle it on/off for each individual Pokemon too. The toggle adds +3 seconds per evolve to account for the time to scroll down, hit transfer, confirm, and wait the notification. I ran through a few test cases and the maths seems ok, but let me know if you encounter any weird behaviour. The best way to reach me is through a PM on reddit.

Moved rest of edits to the bottom. Read there for updates.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So for background I'm 25, work 2nd shift, and come home (as a machinist) covered in oil/metal/coolant/etc.

There is a popular spot with 6 pokestops all around a small yard in front of Town hall/post office/memorials/town pool. So its a nice spot to walk around and hit all 6 pokestops for a half hour or so.

I get out of work 1130, I get there about 1145 and I stay until 1215 a few days a week. Most of the time there's 5-10 other people there minding their own business and sometimes make small talk.

Last night I go there as usual and do my thing before I go home and do my nightly ritual. There's a group of super fucking obnoxious highschool kids just generally being the worst part of everyone's day. They harassed a man in his 40s walking his dog, a girl in her 20s with her friend had to walk to the other side of the street because they were physically touching them, and eventually they came to me.

I'm covered in grime, tired, and took my motorcycle from my house up to this little park for pokemon and a little ride-time. One of the kids makes a comment about me looking dirty and asks if I'm homeless and I just explain I got off work. Kids laughs and rolls his eyes, whatever I don't care I'm just off work and they're the smallest part of my day. Now when they throw a rock at me and scratch the visor on my helmet, I go over and politely inform them to fuck off or they're going to have a problem. I ask who did it and if they have the balls to admit it. Of course not. I tell them off, go back to my bench and resume my last 10m on my incense.

Now here's the part where they fuck up bad.

One of the little shits walks by me and gives me a smirk, I stare him down until he turns his head and passes by, basically telling him to fuck off I'm not in the mood.

The little dipshit calls out to me as he's next to my motorcycle, 3000$ and just bought 2 weeks prior. 

The dumb fuck kicks it over.

Now at this point I put my phone into my pocket and calmly walk over, about to make sure he doesnt leave before I call the cops. The kid hits me in the chest and goes ""Do something bitch"" and to make a long story short the cops were there 10m later after the aforementioned guy walking his dog + the two girls pried me off the kid, who now has a broken nose and 2 black eyes.


Before you white knights jump on me, he had ample warning not to mess with me and until he put his hands on me I was merely going to keep him there until the cops arrived. If he hadn't touched me he would have only had to deal with the police and his parents.

The point of the story is this.


THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. YOU ARE NOT ON THE INTERNET WHERE YOU CAN MESS WITH PEOPLE WITH NO CONSEQUENCE. 

 I am off with no consequences with 6 people witnessing them antagonizing me far past the point necessary, 2 girls talking to the officers get dipshit and his friends in line for a sexual harassment lawsuit,  while dipshit spent the night in jail, and will be paying for brand new side panels on my bike. Oh and the nice assault charge that's going to ruin his life. Thank god for security cameras.

It could have gone much worse for little dipshit. It could have been in a much worse neighborhood where he pushed someone too far and gotten stabbed and left for dead.

Don't be this kid. He had his ass beat, spent the night in jail, and is getting sued by 3 different people basically for trying to act tough in front of his friends.


Don't harass people, don't mess with their stuff, keep your hands off the ladies, and don't be a dipshit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Phrasing and removing some specifics to not draw attention to the kid/place it happened.

Edit2: If someone touches you or harasses you in a public place, call the cops. People have PM'd me asking things and this is the advice I have. You don't need to get in a fight. Stay in public places at night and make sure there's someone within earshot if you need help. Most people who play are good honest people who will help you if you need it. The police are there to help, harassment is serious. Anyone touches you, defend yourself and get out of the situation.

Edit3: From the police call this morning him and a couple others are being charged with assault (throwing rocks at people), sexual assault/harrasment (groping the girls, they both are charging apparently), and they asked if I wanted to charge for battery since the kid hit me and it was on security camera for the building. I'm not pressing charges but filled out forms for ""destruction of property."" His parents are most likely going to have to replace the plastics/1 handlebar on my bike.

Edit4: Thank you all for your kind words, especially the PM's. I'm a really introverted guy and this has really been bothering me until I put the story up here. Thank you all for being so supportive. It means a lot.

Edit5/6: Thanks for the (2x) gold kind stranger(s). I appreciate it, but please consider giving to others who could use it more.  https://www.specialolympics.org/  http://www.vday.org/  http://leorf.org/  https://www.directrelief.org/

Once it loaded up, I noticed another human character other than myself walking around on my screen. He walked for a bit and then stopped. My first assumption was that there had been an update to Pokemon Go, so I closed the app and checked r/pokemongo but I found nothing mentioning a new update.

I opened Pokemon Go again, once the game loaded up I had noticed he was walking closer, directly towards my character. At that point I realized that if I could see him, he more than likely could see me. I checked Google, the newest r/pokemongo posts, and even the Niantic twitter. Still nothing.

When I turned back to check Pokemon Go, the other character was standing right outside my apartment. This is when the panic set in. [I took a screencap.](http://i.imgur.com/xhAvvNF.jpg)

I peeked outside my window, someone was standing there. [I took a picture](http://i.imgur.com/E8Qm4VR.jpg) and immediately called the police. By the time they arrived, the individual was long gone and his avatar was nowhere to be seen in the game.

One guy with absolute zero muscle, yet a personality like he was killer strong not to be messed with walks over to our car and knocks on it. After saying ""Hi?"" He responded with how we don't belong in this group and to wait until a second group comes because they will need people. He said only those who showed up first are allowed in the raid.

After brushing him off he angrily shouted to the group to keep us out of it and back out. They ignored him and we fought it all together. The End.

**Here's my suggestion**: an item (I think it should work like incubators- everyone has one, and you can rarely find/buy more) that, as you walk, slowly raises a single pokemon's CP until it's about as strong as something you could find in the wild at your current level, or maybe until it's just a little weaker than the second or third strongest in your collection, to make sure your strongest is always something you caught (meaning hunting and catching is always top priority).

Your ""companion"" pokemon could even show up next to your trainer portrait, to show that it's the one traveling with you on your adventures.

It would be really neat to have your starter pokemon, for example, not just sit at double digit CP forever when a big part of the pokemon lore is about the bond between a trainer and his/her specific pokemon. It would also let people get excited about a rare thing they found on a trip, for example, instead of having to always have your only worthwhile pokemon be your most recent ones.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this has been thought of before!

**Edit**: the companion should also probably only get its CP increase if you're actually catching things, to avoid people just strapping the phone to their ceiling fan, etc. I think those clever tricks are fine for hatching eggs, but not for ""training"".

**Edit the second**- I totally misunderstood how CP caps work. I didn't realize all pokemon's max potential increases with trainer level. So you COULD use your very first pidgey the whole time, but it would be horribly inefficient.

**Edit #3**- the item (let's call it a Companion Ribbon) couldn't be transferred between pokemon. You'd use it on one, and then you could have that pokemon be your companion. If you find another ribbon you could tag a second companion, but you can never have more than one active (gaining cp). ",1468439186.0

Even the best streamers can't consistently hit excellents. It'd surely be a minor concession statistically, but it would be a major psychological boon if excellent throws meant a Pokemon couldn't run away even if it escaped from that throw.

That way when a Pokemon runs away, you are never left feeling like there wasn't a single thing you could've done better. Instead, you'd feel like you could practice your skills harder so that next time you hit more excellents and the Pokemon wouldn't get away.

However everything Pokemon Go has advertised is completely absent and different from the game we have today.

To put it kindly, we ALL said that Pokemon Go's success completely relied on how well the updates were and... I feel like they had one job and failed at it despite how great of a launch it was.

I feel like other companies would not take the resources for granted.

452,Pokemon Go Evolution CP Multiplier Sheet - Know (approximately) how much CP your evolved Pokemon will have!,12874,4t2uzo,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t2uzo/pokemon_go_evolution_cp_multiplier_sheet_know/,726,"Hey everyone!

I created a spreadsheet (inspired by /u/afandrew2000 and /u/pokeagogo) that lists how much CP each Pokemon gains when they evolve. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EYDELiuZuP4gqwtxO_xY_zFjfF_1tnODARhB3Bo2fzM/edit#gid=158941429) the sheet.

**Update:** use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PQVkGncIi7qtmZdnQhLsfv88zR4CIc65M60Cyowacc/edit#gid=134545558) if the original is lagging too much

The data so far is based off community input, so I also created a form that'll auto-update the sheet—when your Pokemon evolve, take note of the before and after CP and contribute to the sheet! [Here's](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctZ7h5aTuyJsSc5M56OZuRmHGnXJy6QvbuBm5xPVegMB9Bhw/viewform#responses) the form in qestion.

Again, numbers are all based on community input, so take 'em with a grain of salt. I'll be sifting through periodically to handle any anomalies/troll inputs, and will be looking to do a deeper dive when I get more data.

We're still missing lots of data for less common Pokemon, so please use the form when you evolve your Pokemon!

Enjoy!



**EDIT 1:** Woah crazy response guys, I'm stoked that this is something useful for other peeps :) 

Thanks to a few trolls, the live sheet may not be accurate all the time, **I've saved a snapshot of the live sheet at a time where the data was 'clean'** (under the aptly-titled ""Snapshot at 0024hrs PST 16 Jun 16 "" sheet) so that there's at least a reliable version of this info if needed.

So a bunch of you have made several really good points about how this model can be improved—here are the changes I plan to make in the near future:

* Trainer level definitely seems to have an impact, will look into the data to figure out how it factors in
* ~~Will add the max and min multipliers for each Pokemon to provide a clearer picture of the range~~ -Done!
* ~~Will add standard deviation for all the submissions for each Pokemon~~ -Done!
* ~~Organize by pokedex order instead of alphabetical order~~ -Done!

This doc is a work in progress. *At this point, I'd say that it gives you an idea of what to expect, but certainly not a guarantee*, so keep that in mind. If you guys have any ideas for improvements, list them below and I'll add them to my to-do list.

Other than that, keep leaving suggestions, or making use of the chart, but I'm going to sleep.  I'll try to keep up with any needed updates the morning

**EDIT 2:** Thanks, trolls, I'm honoured that you think I'm worth your time to actually troll :)

~~Anywho, I'm back, gonna turn off the form for a bit, clean the data and snapshot another 'stable' version of the doc onto a new tab. For those who are looking for a 'backup', there's a second tab in the doc that shows what the sheet looked like last night midnight PST. Refer to that in the meantime if need be.~~ Form is back online and stable version is now the default tab!

~~I'm planning on calculating the standard deviation (for whatever reason =arrayformula(stdeva(if(...))) isn't working as I hoped) so i can weed out any entries that are far in the extremes.~~ 

**EDIT 3:** Alrighty, I've added, due to popular demand, the median multiplier, as well as the standard deviation of the entries of each species of Pokemon. I've also added a troll-safeguard so the live sheet should be more or less stable. 

Also, **huge** shoutout to /u/Joedang100 for crunching the collected data and figuring out that **trainer level does NOT affect the evolution CP multiplier**. Check his work [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/8ylQw).

Next on my to-do list is to further refine accuracy of the data, which will come later tonight (PST). Happy Pokemon Go-ing!

**EDIT 4:** Thanks for the gold!

Added Pokedex numbers, so the ""Live Updating"" sheet is now sorted by Pokedex number. CP increase on power up is under works!

And I hope I'm not the only one!,12642,4txy98,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4txy98/servers_have_been_exceptional_today_and_i_hope_im/,1095,"Having an 8 am that finishes around 9 every morning, I go out to catch Pokes for a solid 4-5 hours since university has excessive amounts of them.

By the end of hunting, I would have killed and restarted the game 20+ times due to bugs during catching Pokes as well as Pokestops making you ""try again later"" while still blue and so on...

Today was a pleasantly different scenario. I have killed the app ZERO times. Zero. The game has run more smoothly than it ever has since launch. I've caught every Poke, aside from the ones who pop out and run away (curse you 1000+CP Magmar!!!!!)

Is this stability going to be forever? I sure hope so. I hope all of you are experiencing the same greatness I have today. It really has been a breath of fresh air relative to what I've dealt with in the past.

I just wanted to share a great server experience as all I've read recently is insane amounts of negativity (rightly so imo).

I am running iOS &amp;amp;amp; am EST, if that matters to any of you.

Happy hunting trainers :)

REV A:

Loving the feedback! I'm glad some of you got to experience the servers being nice and smooth!!

To everyone saying that the servers are always fine until X time, I hunt Pokes at the same time every day M-F since launch. Extremely consistent with my start / stop times as well so it is good experimental data for myself to confidently say that today was different. The best I've experienced since the release date.

To everyone who is still struggling with their experience, I promise you all that the game will be great once they can keep their servers consistently stable! Like many of you I became frustrated with the necessity of constant restarting. Today was a wonderful glimpse of what is to come. It is a thing of beauty.

REV B:

As many have stated, the 3 footsteps bug is NOT fixed. Yes it is quite frustrating. I really enjoyed that aspect of the game. For those of you who don't already know, Pokevision has been a great alternative source to assist in hunting down your Pokes!

I also have another suggestion for those of you who are still struggling! Some may consider it to be common sense, but it surely helps. I will just share what I do to explain. When at university, I have the wifi saved in my phone (obviously). This is great if I plan on sitting in a building to set lures or just wait for Pokes or battle gyms. But whenever I go outside and roam campus, I am sure to cut my wifi off!!!!!! The game will get extremely confused trying to jump from wifi to phone data when you're in spotty areas. Although university is the most likely location this situation will happen, it is good to be conscience of it. It certainly assisted the performance of my gameplay after I noticed the trend.

REV C:

Lots of input and it is great! I'm sorry to everyone who is still struggling with the game.

My roommate and I often take campus strolls in the evening so she can stock up on pokeballs at all the stops. For some reason her phone, android OS, always struggled on campus. Today it was near flawless. Enough for her to state that it was working much better than normal.

My phone would also often struggle during the evening. Tonight was different. We went to a gym that I knew I could take over CP-wise. I was looking to collect a shield bonus because pokecoins. This was easily the smoothest gym battle I ever experienced. I can't wait for it to always be this way! It was beautiful. All Pokes were again captured, unless they popped out and ran away.

That being said, tracking is still wonky. It is quite upsetting. The same issues occur. Sometimes random Pokes appear in nearby menu but really aren't nearby at all (I think GPS thinks you're near a different location than reality, or something of the like). Restarting the app seems to consistently solve that. It's bizarre. Also the tracking in general is still busted.

We went ~7-9 EST. For everyone saying that player base has dropped significantly, I had never seen campus so lively during our evening visits. It was quite the surprise! Im sure there has in fact been a drop in users since the game's release and all of the initial hype, but I don't think it is as significant as one might think! I personally don't think that really even matters until the game is released worldwide as intended with consistently fluent servers. Show me the numbers then.

I really wish everyone could experience silky smooth gameplay that I endured today. It was wonderful. My fingers are crossed for the same solidity tomorrow.

Also, PoGo has (I believe) officially been released in Japan, so hopefully everything I'm saying doesn't turn into utter garbage overnight. Fingers now double crossed.

- To throw a curveball you can shake the ball in a circular motion until it sparkles, this will give the throw a lot of spin so it might take some getting used to. 

- The egg menu is swiped to from your pokemon menu. You have one permanent incubator but you can obtain disposable ones with limited uses to hatch multiple eggs at the same time. You need to walk to hatch eggs (driving will not work unless you are crawling at like 10 Km/h)

- Pokemon of the same species can have different moves
The color of the circle when you are catching a pokemon reveals the difficult of catching it (green/yellow/orange/red)

- Once you are level five you choose a faction by entering any gym. This decides what color your gyms are, ALL gyms of your faction color are allies, the greyish gyms are unclaimed, ALL other gyms are rivals.

- Fighting an allied gym is called ""training"", you can lose etc here but your pokemon cannot faint in training and winning gives you a bit of exp and prestige for you gym. Losing in a rival gym faints your pokemon and they can only be revived with items.

- Prestige is best thought of as life points for your gym. If a rival faction beats your gym enough times you run out and are evicted from the gym which becomes up for grabs again.

- You can only place one pokemon per player in a gym, so if you have friends you can stack a strong team in a single gym to protect your turf.

- When your gym is defeated and the pokemon in it are evicted they return to your party.

- Typing does matter (Electric beats water) though there seems to be some hidden values as well for things like how fast a pokemon attacks, Seadra in particular is really OP feeling. 

- In the 4 hours I played I used about 80% of my iPhone 5s' battery and only 23MB of data.

- Stardust is a currency used to power up any pokemon, it is acquired by catching any pokemon. Catching a pokemon for the first time or with special throws will give you a bonus.

- Candies are a currency used to power up and/or evolve a pokemon. It is acquired by catching pokemon or transferring them to Prof. Willow. You will only get candies of the species of pokemon in either method and the species' candy can be used on evolutions (A nidoran candy can be used to power up a nidorino/nidoking).

- Pokestops recharge every 5 minutes with no daily limits.

- Also, I want to add that if you have Pokemon occupying a gym, you can collect rewards! Go to Shop, and on the top right you will see a circle with a number on it. The number reflects how many Pokemon are occupying gyms. You get 10 Pokecoins per Pokemon and I forgot how much stardust, 400 each I want to say? Can't recall, I didn't realize what that was. Anyway, you can only ""cash out"" once every 21 hours apparently. **Credit to ArturPrakapas** Confirmed: you receive 10 Pokecoins and 500 stardust per pokemon placed in a gym.

- You can only cash in on 10 gyms max for a total of 100 pokecoins and 5000 stardust **Credit to Xeroith**

- When you fight a gym there are little bars filling up while you spam your basic attack (depends whoch moveset you have it changes the speed cast and how much you need to fill), and those bars are your special attack pp. In order to use them keep pressing anywhere in the screen and a little bar starts loading under them. Once it's loaded you release your finger and the special attack goes off. It cosumes 1 bar each time. **Credit to NapzorTree**

- Hatching an egg gives trainer exp and random number of candies (I have received up to 21 personally) of the pokemon hatched. 



New info 07/10/2016

- The inner circle that decreases in size is a bullseye, hitting within it as it gets smaller results in a nice, great, or excellent throw.

##There is a great IV (Individual Value)( HP / STR / STAM / DEF ) [Calculator](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGOIVs/comments/4v23ky/faq_on_ivs_info_megathread/) to determine how close your Pokemon is to perfect. I still haven't found anything supporting Weight/Size having anything to do with max CP. Seems to all be based on their 4 stats.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Someone has data mined the game and found a lot of useful information. You can find that information here:
[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/4tdzom/a_member_of_my_pokemon_go_group_had_the_core/). Thanks to /u/allancaesar for finding the information and posting it!**

**Some key Points:**

- The Trainer Level Cap is 40.

- Egg's cap at Level 20, so if you get an Egg at Level 37 it'll still hatch at the same quality as if you were level 20.

- Wild Pokemon cap at Level 30, meaning after Level 30 everyone will find the same max CP Pokemon and it'll be a matter of spending the candy and stardust to upgrade them to your level's cap based on their CP arc.

- Curveballs and Accurate Throws (Nice, Great, Etc) have been confirmed as helping with the capture chance of a Pokeball throw.

- Moves have an Accuracy and a Critical Hit Rate.

- Each unique Pokemon has it's own Capture and Flee rate.

- **STAB is present in the game, giving a 25% Bonus to an attack move. STAB stands for ""Same Type Attack Bonus"" and means if a Grass Pokemon uses a Grass move it will hit harder than if a Ground Pokemon used the same Grass move. This is a big deal confirmation.** *VERY Important to know.*

- **Defending Pokemon at a Gym attack every 1.5 seconds.** *VERY Important to know.*

&nbsp;

**Q:** Why does my Pokedex only show ""##"" Pokemon? Do they not have all 150 in the game?

**A:** Just like in the old gameboy games, your Pokedex will only count up to the number of the last Pokemon you caught. At the beginning it's only going to show 1, 3, or 9. Once you get Dragonite it will show 149. Mewtwo 150 and everything in between.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Why is my character in the middle of a huge body of water when I log in?

**A:** Your GPS isn't able to locate you. Make sure your Location settings are set to High Accuracy. If it is, turn on WiFi. Even if you're not connected to WiFi your phone will still ping nearby routers to help locate you.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Will walking when the app is closed still count towards my eggs hatching?

**A:**Walking without the game open does NOT count towards your eggs hatching. 

Additionally, going faster than 20KPH / 12MPH does not count towards your egg distance.

&nbsp;

**Q:** I see green stuff moving around on my map. What is that?

**A:** Those are ""Rustling Leaves"". There may or may not be Pokemon in that location.

&nbsp;

**Q:** I got ""Nice!"" on a ball throw. What does that mean?

**A:** That means you got 10 bonus XP! Also, this increases your capture chance.

You get bonuses for certain throws.

There are 4 known so far: 

Nice! 10 XP - Your gauge circle was near the outer ring and your ball hit inside of that circle.

Great! 50 XP - Your gauge circle was near the middle and your ball hit inside of that circle.

Excellent 100 XP - Bullseye! Your gauge circle was near the center and your ball hit inside of that tiny circle!

Curve Ball! 10 XP - Your thumb likely tilted a little when you swiped up, and somehow miraculously you hit the pokemon. Just kidding! You can also click on the ball and swipe it in circles to make it spin. This one takes some practice.


&nbsp;

**Q:** When you find pokemon do they spawn with a random CP?

**A:** Yes, they spawn at a random CP to an extent. Two players of different levels will see Pokemon of different CP. Higher level players could see a CP14 while a lower level see a CP 200 and visa versa. Higher level players do have the chance, of course, of seeing much higher CP than a lower level player.


*Note: After sitting next to another lv24 player while hunting I've found that players that are the same level will see the same CP pokemon. We both caught 1777 Snorlax, then a 538 Magmar, and started comparing from there. All of our pokemon spawned with the same CP.*

&nbsp;

**Q:** It seems like everytime I throw a Pokeball the Pokemon jumps or attacks. What should I do?

**A:** This is just part of it. You'll get better at throwing the ball over time. Rolling your thumb/finger and making the ball curve by accident is the most annoying.

*ProTip: After level 20 Pokemon will start slashing and jumping after you've already thrown a Pokeball. To avoid this throw your Pokeball toward the end of a Pokemon's jump or attack animation. The ball should land on them as they finish their animation.* **This method seems to have been patched. You can no longer throw Pokeballs during animation**

&nbsp;

**Q:** What is the fastest way to level up?

**A/O:** The most common method is to get the most out of your lucky eggs. To do this:

* Save Pidgeys, Rattatas, Weedles, Caterpies, etc. (Any common Pokemon costing 12 or 25 to evolve)
* Use your lucky Egg right before your eggs are about to hatch.
* While your lucky egg is active evolve all of the Pokemon you can. *Do not evolve Pidgeottos into Pidgeots unless you need them for battling.*
* Use the remaining time to catch all Pokemon that you see as well as hitting any Pokestops you pass by. Double experience applies to all of these. Also, if you're able to, you can attack a Gym once.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Why shouldn't I evolve Pidgeotto into Pidgeot? It gives 1000 XP!

**A/O:** Your first Pidgeot gave you 1000XP. That is because you gained 500 XP for the evolve and 500 XP for the new Pokemon added to your Pokedex. If you don't need another Pidgeot, don't evolve them.

Here's why:

4 Pidgeys = 48 candies = 2k XP // 4K with Egg

1 Pidgeotto = 50 candies = 500XP // 1K with Egg

&nbsp;

**Q:** Some of my Pokemon have a blue aura around them in my bag. What does this mean?

**A:** This indicates that the Pokemon was recently caught or acquired.

&nbsp;

**Q:** THERE'S A SNORLAX NEAR ME!! How do I locate Pokemon?

**A:** In the bottom right corner of your travel screen you will see a white bar. This bar will show the 3 closest Pokemon to you (generally). If you click on that bar you can see all (up to 9) pokemon near you. ~~These pokemon will have footsteps below them. Each footstep is rumored to be equivalent to 75-150 meters.~~

~~When the locator is open you can select the specific Pokemon you want to track. Once you've selected the Pokemon simply start walking. If you're walking in the general direct of the selected Pokemon there will be a green pulse. This is good!~~

~~Keep an eye on this pulse and keep walking. As you get closer it should pulse a little more frequently and the footsteps will go lower until it they disappear. Once the footsteps disappear the Pokemon should spawn. If the footsteps suddenly go back up, change direction slightly and start walking again.~~

*Note: This feature, for the most part, has been removed.*

##**Pokemon 1.0**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** Do higher level players see different Pokemon than I do?

**A:** No. The only thing that Trainer level effects is what CP the Pokemon can spawn at. All Pokemon spawn via the map. The only thing that spawns based on a single Trainer would be Pokemon from Incense.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Where should I go to find ""XYZ"" Pokemon?

**A/O:** Literally any populated area. You will find the rarest Pokemon in crazy areas when you least expect it.

Some players know where more uncommon/rare Pokemon spawn. I.E: Hitmochan spawns constantly at Public Square in Nashville.

 Ask local groups or players that you pass. Just make sure they're welcome to the conversation. Don't bother anyone that is obviously wanting to be left alone.

Most cities have Facebook Groups. They're a great resource.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Should I use stardust to raise the CP of my Pokemon?

**A/O:** I don't believe that anyone should be powering up Pokemon below level 20-25. Your main focus should be on leveling up. As you level you will find stronger base CP Pokemon. Also, it takes so much longer to level after lv20 that you will hold on to these Pokemon longer. They're not as easily replaced as they are from lv1-19.

*Everyone will enjoy playing their game differently.* It has just been my experience that it is a waste of stardust to power up something you will replace. I spent stardust until I was level 12 or 13. I pumped all of my dust into a Poke and then replaced it 3 levels later.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Should I boost the CP of my Pokemon before or after I evolve it?

**A/O:** All information that I've found shows that this doesn't matter. A Pokemon will still max out at a certain CP based on your level.

&nbsp;

**Q:** When you take a gym, how long before you're able to claim the gym rewards?

**A/O:** You can collect your rewards immediately. You do this through the shop menu. There is a shield icon with a number in it representing the amount of Pokemon you have holding Gyms. Gyms reward you with 10G and 500SD for each Pokemon controlling a gym up to a max of 10. You can collect this reward once every 21 hours.

I normally collect at night right after I'm done for the day.

&nbsp;

**Q:** I just caught a 313 Squirtle. Should I evolve it, or wait?

**A/O:** I would wait. Most of the stronger Tier 3's require 100 candies, while Tier 2 only costs 25. My opinion is that you should wait until you have the full 125 candies required and then evolve the strongest Pokemon you have.

If you evolve Squirtle with 25 candies, there's a good chance you will regret it later due to the fact you will almost definitely find a stronger replacement by the time you get another 100 candies.

If you know any of the chart above to be incorrect, let me know. Thanks!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

**Q:** At a Gym, how do you battle? Just tap on the opponent?

**A:** Yes, most of your damage should come from your basic attack. Just tap as fast as you can. I prefer a low damage high speed attack that will absolutely shred opponents. (Like Water Gun)

&nbsp;

**Q:** How do I use my special attack? The bars are full.

**A:** Simply tap and hold on your screen when you have a full charge. You will see a small blue line move right to left under your charge bars. Once it's farthest left you will use the special attack. I prefer a high damage, low charge special attack. (Like Hydro Pump) One or two bars max. As I said above, most of your damage should come from basic attacking.

&nbsp;

**Q:** What are Gym rewards? How do I claim my Gym rewards?

**A:** When your Pokemon are in a Gym they reward you with 10 gold(G) and 500 Stardust(SD) each, up to a maximum of 10.

You can claim your rewards via the ""Shop"" Menu. In the top right corner you will see a shield emblem. This emblem will have a number that corresponds to the number of Pokemon you currently have defending a Gym. Click on that icon to collect your reward.

Once you collect your reward, you will have a 21HR cooldown before you can collect again.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Is there a limit to how many Pokemon I can have in Gyms?

**A:** Not that I am aware of. You *ARE* limited to one Pokemon, per Gym. As far as multiple Gyms go; I believe you can have as many as you want. You can only collect rewards on up to 10 of them. (100G and 5000SD)

&nbsp;

**Q:** When you take a gym, how long before you're able to claim the gym rewards?

**A/O:** You can collect your rewards immediately. You do this through the shop menu. There is a shield icon with a number in it representing the amount of Pokemon you have holding Gyms. Gyms reward you with 10G and 500SD for each Pokemon controlling a gym up to a max of 10. You can collect this reward once every 21 hours.

I normally collect at night right after I'm done for the day.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Is there a way to prestige gyms faster? It takes forever!

**A:** When you first take a gym, have the lowest level player with you put a low CP Pokemon in it (400CP Pidgey or the sort). Then train against that Pokemon over and over with a Pokemon that has less CP (399 Voltorb). You will gain around 500 Prestige each time. Once you've gained enough prestige, then have everyone add their stronger Pokemon.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##**Items 2.0**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** How do I use a Lure Module?

**A:** You simply click on the Pokestop you want to attach it to. Once there, look above the Circle frame (that you would spin to get items) and above it you will see a little white pill shaped icon. Click on it, select your Lure module, and then click your module again. It should now be activated.


&nbsp;

**Q:** How do I get more potions, Pokeballs, etc.?

**A:** You can purchase Pokeballs, but all items can be gathered from Pokestops. To collect items from a Pokestop you simple spin the picture in the center.

*Note: You cannot (to my knowledge) collect premium items from Pokestops. (Incense, Incubators, Lure Modules, Lucky Eggs)

*Note: You do NOT have to click each item when they come out. Spin until it turns purple and hit the ""X"". It will give you all of the items.*

*Note 2: Sometimes the Pokestop won't load. Still spin the crap out of it. More times than not, it will give you the items. You can check your journal, or reload your game and see that the Pokestop is purple. Also, if the Pokestop is still blue, but says ""Try again later"" you've gotten your items from it.*

&nbsp;

**Q:** I tried to collect from a Pokestop but it just spins and says ""Try again later"". Why?

**A:** This is a bug. You've received your items, but the Pokestop hasn't turned purple. If you need confirmation just reload your game. The Pokestop will be purple.

&nbsp;


**Q:** My bag keeps getting full and I'm running out of Pokeballs, what do?

**A:** Delete your extra Potions, revives, and Razzberries. You don't need 90 of any of them, ever. At lv20 you'll have 3 different types of Potions and Pokeballs. I never keep more than 60 total potions and 40 revives on me. I delete excess. The rest of the room I keep for Pokeballs. After level 20 you'll start having CP56 Pidgeys escape Pokeballs and running frequently. You have to have a large surplus of Pokeballs.

As you get to a higher level you will likely start Gym battling more, thus needing more Potions and the sort. At this point you should be able to use your best judgment on bag space.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** Does incense stack with a Lure Module?

**A:** Yes.

**Lure module:** Everyone in the area is able to see Pokemon that spawn from the Lure Module.

**Incense:** Only the player with incense active will be able to see these Pokemon. They will spawn with the pink incense ring around them to signify that they spawned from incense.


*Note: Multiple players in the same location with incense active MAY OR MAY NOT able to see the same incense spawned Pokemon.*

&nbsp;

**Q:** Do Lure Modules stack with other Lure Modules?

**A:** Yes. They each attract their own Pokemon. If you've ever been in an area where three drop at once, you'll notice each stop typically spawns a pokemon of it's own immediately. From there, they will all randomly produce their own Pokemon for the next 30 minutes.

&nbsp;

**Q:** If a lure is going on..do I need to be inside the circle to get the benefit? Or does the lure generally spawn pokemon within a broad area near it?

**A:** For lures you just need to be within the range of your avatar, not the circle of the Pokestop. As long as you're in the general area you'll see them.
The Pokemon from the lure are separate from the ones on your locator. You can still go hunt them down.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now, for the PSA**

* If your local park, cemetary, etc. closes at a certain time; LEAVE. People not knowing when to call it quits will create a huge problem for the rest of the players. Police shouldn't have to feel like they're wrangling cats to get people out of a location.

&nbsp;

* If you're at a resturant/bar with a Pokestop **PLEASE** be aware that you're sitting on someone's livelyhood. It's ok to sit around and I'm sure they won't mind, but if you're going to stay at a table for long after you've finished your meal please leave them a good tip. You're taking up a space for them to seat another guest.

&nbsp;

* If you're in a metropolitan area (Example: Downtown Nashville), or anywhere for that matter. Pick up large items of trash and throw them away if there are trashcans readily available. 
I'm not saying to grab a spike and head out with a Hefty bag, or pick up every cigarette butt (unless its yours), but don't just pass the stuff up. Everyone needs a little extra karma and we definitely need less trash on the streets.

&nbsp;

* The above can also be applied to Cemeteries. If you see flowers blown off of a grave from a previous storm or wind, pick it up and set it on a grave that needs it. You don't have to hunt the matching flowers down.

&nbsp;

* I've heard of people at parks being pretty vicious towards players. Upset due to walking/bike paths being crowded, people walking through disc golf courses, etc. Do not react with violence. Try to get away from these people. If necessary call the cops. Also, be self aware. If you're standing, walking, etc. completely oblivious to the world. You're causing a problem. Don't be the problem. If you're on a walkway/bikeway. Keep it moving, and keep right.

Check to see if your local park also includes a disc golf course. If you see metal baskets with chains, try to keep an eye out for players playing. If you notice that you might be in their way, try to be quick about what you're doing.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Hopefully someone finds some kind of useful information in this rambling. If you have other questions just ask. I'll be glad to answer it, or find and answer for you if another member of the sub doesn't beat me to it.

Eggsecutes have been spawning there, I caught 6 this morning.  So I'm driving through parking lots, walking around baseball fields and tennis courts, and keeping to myself.  The park management had so many phone calls about me they had to send a staff member to talk to me to see what I was doing.  The park staff was cool, even first walking up to me he greeted me with ""You're playing Pokemon, aren't you?""  We had a laugh over it, and he let me be on my way.  What annoys me though, is the notion that a man by himself in a park is obviously some kind of creep or predator.  Since when are parks only for women and kids?

This was at like 10 AM today.  I just couldn't believe they got so many calls they had to send a staff member out.

End Rant, sorry.

Edit:  Just to be clear, I'm not offended that they called staff on me, or mad at the staff in anyway.  I just think its pitiful we live in a society that teaches women, especially young mothers, that they should fear all men because a vast minority are harmful.  Not only that, but that its acceptable to discriminate against all men because of the acts of a very few.  I feel bad for women that have to go out in fear because they've been conditioned to think men are out to hurt them.",1474949298.0

It's extremely frustrating to beat 3-4 Pokemon OVER and OVER again to place a Pokemon in a gym and some low level player from a different team comes a long, places a 300cp Golbat or Gloom and has their friends place low tier Pokemon.

It's just stupid to think that if I beat a gym I don't get to place a Pokemon straight away, instead some random person walking by sees a gym without anyone in it and thinks ""oh cool I can put my pokemon here"" And you end up using up your revives and potions for NO REASON but to knock someone out of the gym you just spent a fair amount of time beating.

TL;DR why the fuck can randoms from different teams place pokemon in a gym you just EARNED.

I keep adding to it as i come across stuff.**

Below is a compilation of tips from a few days playing.

#Gym Battles

##How do i take part in Gym Battles?

* To get involved in gym battles, you first need to get to level 5. If you click on a gym before level 5, you'll get some dialog that basically says, ""Come back when you are level 5"".

* Once you are level 5, when you first click on a gym (even if its out of range), you will be asked to join a team (after a bunch of story text).  I dont believe their are any differences in the team at present, so just pick your favorite color which is team red. 

* To actually take part in a gym battle, you need to get within range (just like a pokestop) and click on the gym.

##What can you do at an enemy Gym?

* When you goto an enemy gym, your goal is to take it over and make it your color.  To do that, you need to lower the prestige of the gym so that the gym boots out the current occupants.  Once they have been kicked out, the Gym will turn White which means its free for anyone to take over.  The first person to put a Pokemon into the Gym will capture it for their team.

##How many opponents are at the Gym?

* When you click on the Gym, up the top it will say the level of the gym.  The level determines how many Pokemon can be stationed at the gym.  So if the Gym is level 3, there can be 3 Pokemon in the Gym.  Just under the level, there will be a crown icon and maybe a few ""dots"" beside it.  The Crown is the leader of the gym and the dots are the other Pokemon at the gym.

* If you have clicked on the gym, swiping left/right will show you which Pokemon are actually in the gym and what their combat power is.

* The Pokemon with the highest Combat Power (CP) is the leader - so if you add a Pokemon to one of your teams gym and your Pokemon has higher CP, you become the leader of the gym.

##How do you lower the prestige of the gym?

* To lower the prestige of a gym, you need to fight and win against the defenders.  So when you get in range of the gym and click it, you will see a ""boxing glove"" icon down the bottom right.  Pressing that will pop up a small screen that will show your best 6 Pokemon based on health/CP (so as Pokemon lose health, they will slip out of your top 6).  If your happy with the team selected, just hit ""Go"".

* Sometimes the game gets stuck between hitting the ""Go"" and before the fight starts - if it happens, restart the app and then just do the above again.

* I still stand by my recommended strategy of simply tapping as fast as you can in the combat.  It does make it easier if your team does ""super effective"" damage against the enemy. so if you can work that into your team compisition, it will make it easier.  But i have not had much success with dodge or power attacks when tapping fast just seems to do the job.

* As you beat the enemy Pokemon at the gym, the prestige of the gym will decrease.  You need 2000 prestige per Pokemon stationed at the gym.  So as the prestige lowers, there will be less Pokemon defending.  

##How does fighting work in the Gym Battles?

* The big thing to realise is that the combat in the gym battles is not turn based, its real time.  This has some pros and cons.  The core thing you need to know is that the faster you tap the screen, the more attacks you are doing.  So against the AI, you are simply attacking more times then them by tapping fast.  I found i performed way worse if i tried to dodge / special attack.

* So everytime you tap the screen to attack, you will build up the blue bars.  When you have enough blue bars to cast your special (if you click on your Pokemon outside of combat, the number of blue bars next to their skill is the number of blue bars you need to cast the special), simply tap and hold the screen for about a half a second and it will register the special attack.  Then i recommend going back to tapping :)

* You may be required to dodge as Pokemon get stronger but for now, i still stand by my method of just tapping that screen as fast as possible.

* If you are an experienced Pokemon player, if you can setup your team to have Pokemon that do ""super effective"" damage to the enemy Gym team, then the furious tapping of the screen will go much faster.  But i've done alright by simply fielding my best 6 Pokemon and just tapping the screen.

##I can only choose 1 Pokemon and not 6, what is happening?

* If you are at a gym of your own team, you will only be able to choose 1 Pokemon and ""train"" it.  If you are at an enemy gym, you can choose 6 pokemon, if your at a friendly gym, you can only choose 1 pokemon.

##What moves can you do in Combat?

You can do 4 things in combat:

* Tab the screen = Attack 
* Swipe left/right = Dodge
* Tap and Hold = Special Move (You require 1 bar of blue built up which is done by attacking)
* Swap the current Pokemon (so far, this just makes you take way too much damage as combat is real time - just constantly tap the screen for now - may change once Pokemon are stronger)

##An example Gym Takeover - From my run around tonight

* So you rock up to an enemy Gym and find out its in range and its a level 3 Gym with 3 Pokemon stationed with a reputation of 6000.  You swipe left to see the relevant Pokemon stationed and you believe you can take it out.

* You decide to fight and for this first fight, you will need to beat all 3 Pokemon to win.  Because you are awesome, you do win the fight and the gym loses 3000 prestige.  So the Gym's prestige goes down to 3000.  Now 3000 prestige is only a level 2 gym, so the lowest level Pokemon gets kicked out as the Gym can know only support 2 Pokemon

* Because you are feeling good, you decide to fight the gym again.  You still get to select 6 Pokemon but it will automatically select your best 6.  This time, the you only have to beat 2 Pokemon (the enemy Pokemon are restored to full health between fights) before you are declared the winner.  You breeze through this challenge and win the fight, the gym losses 2500 prestige.  This leaves it with only 500 prestige which takes the gym down to level 1.  This means the gym can only support 1 Pokemon so the worst Pokemon is booted out.

* Now this gym only has 1 Pokemon defending it and its the leader.  So you once again challenge the gym and this time you easily crush it with your 6 Pokemon team.  This loss takes the prestige of the gym to 0 and so the enemy team is booted out of the gym and it becomes white (neutral)

* When you click on the gym this time, down the bottom left you will see an icon which will allow you to put one of your Pokemon in the gym to claim it.  Doing that and the Gym is now your teams color.  

##What happens to the Pokemon that i station at the Gym?

* The Pokemon that you add to a gym will become unavailable for you to use in any other gym fights and you will be unable to power up or evolve them until they have returned to your Pokemon list.

* When they do finally get defeated by another player, they will return to you with only 1 health so you will need to heal them up again before they will be useful.

* You are also only able to add full health Pokemon to gyms, the app wont let you assign non-full health Pokemon to the gym.

* For each Pokemon you have stationed in a gym (it doesnt matter if you are the leader of the gym or not), you are able to claim rewards from the shop.  You get 10 gold coins and 500 stardust for each Pokemon stationed at gyms.  It only counts up to 10 Pokemon, so there is no real benefit to having more then 10 Pokemon stationed at gyms at one time except for world domination.

*  If you are just after the shop bonus, maybe its better to put in a Pokemon that you were about to turn into candy from the professor so you dont need to heal it when it returns. 

##What can you do at a friendly Gym?

* The goal when you goto a friendly gym is to reinforce the gym so that its harder for enemies to take it over.  To do this, you need to add a Pokemon to the gym.  However, the gym will only allow 1 Pokemon per gym level to be stationed at the gym. 

* It requires 2000 prestige per gym level, so if the gym is already ""full"" for its current level, you wont have the option to add a Pokemon to the gym.

##How can i raise the prestige of a friendly gym

* To raise the prestige of a friendly gym, you need to ""train"".  You do this the same way you take over a gym with the following MAJOR exception, you can only choose ONE Pokemon to fight.  So if you want to add a Pokemon to a gym that already has 2 Pokemon from your team in it, you need to train a Pokemon that can beat both of those 2 Pokemon.

* If you just beat one Pokemon, the gym's prestige will still rise but not as much.

* You need to repeat the training until you have added enough prestige to the gym to make it level up (It takes 2000 prestige for each level of the gym).

* Once the gym has received enough prestige, you will see the icon to add a Pokemon to the gym (bottom left) becomes available.

##Do my Pokemon take damage from training?

* Yes - the exception is that your Pokemon wont faint/die even if you lose during training but they will need to be healed still with the purple potions.  But you wont ever have to revive them as they stop training right before they reach that point (i guess :) )

* If you lose a fight againt an enemy gym, your Pokemon will faint/die and will need to be revived before healing.

##What does training do for the Pokemon?

* The short answer is nothing - Pokemon dont level up or get stronger by fighting or training.  However, their are some badges that are rewarded for you training X times.  Beating 1 Pokemon is counted as training.  So if you train at a gym with 2 Pokemon, and beat them both, that counts as training 2 times.

##Can i put multiple Pokemon in a gym?

* No - Each player can only put 1 Pokemon in a gym regardless of the level of the Gym.  So if a Gym is level 3, and has a space for another Pokemon, but you already have one in it, you want have the option to add another Pokemon.  Someone else from your team needs to add a Pokemon to strengthen the Gym

##Any sneaky tricks to training

* If you takeover a gym, put a 10cp Pokemon inside.  Then do training on that gym with a strong Pokemon and watch how fast you get those training numbers up.  You only get a tiny bit of xp doing this so its only worthwhile if you are wanting to increase you ""number of times trained"" stat.

##What is the point of taking over gyms / putting Pokemon in gyms?

* Once every 20 hours, you can get some rewards from the shop menu.  You get 10 gold coins and 500 Dust for every Pokemon that you currently have stationed in gyms (Up to a max of 10 Pokemon - so a total of 100 gold coins and 5000 dust per 20 hour cooldown).  To claim this, goto the ""Shop"" and up the top right will have a Shield that shows the number of Pokemon you have stationed at gyms.  Remember, other people can take back over the gym and boot your Pokemon out before you claim your reward - so work out the best time to claim if you are doing a run around a series of gyms.

##Yes - Multiple people can attack a Gym at the same time!!

* On the map, you can tell if a gym is currently being attacked as you will see some ""fighting actions"" happening on the top of the gym.  To join the fight, just get in range of the Gym and attack it as you normally would.

* The other players will also show up on your screen battling - the defending Pokemon will only attack 1 of the players at a time so anyone else can get free hits in.  However, the last time we did this, we got stuck on the bug where the enemy had a tiny bit of health and tapping the screen did nothing.

##What's the max gym level?

*The max gym level is level 10.  The prestige cost per level is not linear and after the first 3 - 5 levels, will cost more then just 2000 prestige a level.  For gyms that are completely filled out, you are going to need to chip away at them over time, or attack them with multiple people at once.

#Finding Pokemon in the Wild

##How do i find wild pokemons to capture?

* Wild pokemons are all over the place.  I believe there is some sort of time based setting where if you leave your phone for long enough, a wild pokemon is going to spawn near you regardless of where you are and regardless of what the ""nearby"" button says.

* On the map, if you see areas where you get wild grass animating, pokemon are more likely to be around those areas.  You will normally find multiple pokemon in those areas and your more likely to get multiple to spawn at the same time.  Though i believe everywhere can spawn a pokemon potentially based on a timer since your last encounter with a wild pokemon.

##I see a wild pokemon on the map, now what?

* If you see a wild pokemon on the map, you want to try and double tap on it - this can be painful if they are right next to a pokestop/gym - as the pokestop/gym take preference and the app seems to ""help"" you select these rather then the pokemon.

* **Single click** on the Pokemon model (not the circle underneath them) to initiate the capture.  You know your ""click"" has registered as the pokeball and your player portrait will disappear.  If this happens, just wait for the capture to start. I've had no issues starting a capture once i started only single clicking on the pokemon model. 

##What does the rustling grass mean on the map?

* From my experience, rustling grass just represents an area where pokemon are near.  Basically, if you see an area with multiple ruslting grasses, it means there is more likely to be pokemon around that area.  You typically find these types on things in park like areas.  You can still find pokemon anywhere, but if you head towards rustling grass, there seems to be a higher chance of an encounter especially if you just roam around those areas.

##I can't see any pokemon around me, will some spawn near me?

* If you leave your phone on , plugged in and running the app, you will find pokemon will eventually spawn on you without you actually moving.  So i believe there is some sort of ""timer"" that if you havent had an encounter for X time, the game spawns one near you.  

##How Does The Nearby Pokemon Tab Work?

* Nearby Pokemon is actually quite powerful once you know how it works.  It basically seems to be a linear scale in regards to the distance to the Pokemon and the number of footsteps.  The only one that i think may not be this way is the 3 footsteps.  I think the 3 footsteps means 3+.

* I added an image that shows the distances based on a test i've done.  100% of the time that the Pokemon has had 0 footsteps, when i have clicked it, it has spawned within 5 to 10 seconds.  I have also 100% reproduced that once a Pokemon goes outside your circle range, it changes from 0 footsteps to 1 footstep

[Image That Shows Footstep Distance](http://i.imgur.com/i91sYzr.png)

* You should be able to use these tips to track down specific Pokemon that show in your nearby (aslong as they are atleast a 2 footstep as 3 may be a bit hard).

#Capturing Pokemon

##How do i capture the pokemon?

* Once you are in the capture screen, the goal is to throw the pokeball so that it hits the pokemon on the full.  If it bounces, goes over them or misses, well you have to try again.  Each throw will take 1 pokeball so you dont want to miss.  In saying that, you will eventually get your eye in where you can hit them with 1 shot 80% of the time.

* To throw the pokeball, tap and hold the pokeball, then flick your finger with the right speed/power based on the distance the pokemon is from you.  

##Augmented Reality when capturing is cool, but can i turn it off?

* I recommend turning of AR as it makes capturing pokemon easier and you will look less wierd when doing this in public.  To do this, when you are in the capture screen, at the top right is an AR switch, just toggle that and AR will turn on/off.

##What does the coloured circle mean?

* The color of the circle represents the difficulty of the capture.  Green being the easiest, red the hardest.  A harder pokemon is more likely to resist capture and escape even after you successfully hit it with a pokeball.

* After much testing, i believe the entire purpose of the colored circle is to tell you the difficulty of the catch and it also highlights the area you need to hit to get ""Nice"", ""Great"" and ""Excellent"" throws. Pokemon can still escape capture even if you do a ""Excellent"" throw.

* I have not seen a difference in capturing chance when the colored circle is small or large (at level 16 lost a 80CP rattata on an excellent throw)

* I have not seen a difference in ""throw speed"" if the circle is small or large. 

**You gain some extra experience depending on the type of throw you do and whether you hit that colored circle.**

* Curveball = 10XP
* Nice Throw = 10XP
* Great Throw = 50XP
* Excellent Throw = 100XP

You only get 1 bonus per throw, so even if you do a curve ball and get a ""great throw"" , only the highest XP will show - so you will get 50xp and not 60xp.

##The wild pokemon escaped my pokeball????

* There is a random chance that the pokemon resists capture.  Most of the time, they will stay around and you simply need to throw another pokeball at them to capture them.  However, sometimes they will run away and they disappear from the map and you have missed you chance to capture them.

* I have taken up to 5 captures to actually capture a pokemon before - mostly, if they escape capture once, the next time you get them with a pokeball, it will work.  Its rare that it goes more then 2 times.

##What are these curveballs i've been hearing about?

* To do a curveball, you want to tap and hold the pokeball, rub in a circle so that the pokeball rotates, then flick it like you normally would (except its going to curve obviously).  If you manage to hit a pokemon with a curveball, you gain an extra 10xp (you normally get 100xp from a capture - 600xp if its a pokemon you dont have yet).

* I have had a pokemon escape capture after being hit by a curveball - i'm unsure if it effects capture chance or not, but its definitely not 100% chance to capture if you hit with a curveball.

* But curveballs are quite fun.

##I've found a difficult wild pokemon, can i make the capture easier somehow?

* Once you get up a few levels, you will get some berries, you can use these berries to make your next throw have a higher chance to capture the pokemon.  But it only effects the next 1 throw (regardless of if you hit or not). 

* Berries dont make it a 100% chance to capture, but i definitely feel a difference when i use them on harder Pokemon and it really feels like they dont escape hardly at all - but i have had it happen to me now once or twice.

* As you level up, you get stronger pokeballs which make capturing easier as well.

#Taking Care Of Your Pokemons

##What actions cause my Pokemon to lose hitpoints / faint

* Your Pokemon are only damaged when you take part in Gym fights at an enemy team's gym, Or doing training at a friendly Gym.

* Your Pokemon will faint if you lose them when fighting an enemy gym (requiring you to revive them).

* You Pokemon will only go down to 1 health if you do training with them (so they can just be healed)
 
##Healing your Pokemon

Pokemon do not heal naturally over time , which is a shame, but they also only take damage when you do a Gym battle.  But below are the ways i have found to heal them.

**There are 3 ways to heal your Pokemon:**

* Using a heal (purple) potion from your items
* Powering up your Pokemon (Will restore 1 hp each time - yay!)
* Evolving your Pokemon restores it to the full health of the next level Pokemon

##Reviving your Pokemon

* Your options once a Pokemon has been killed is to either turn them into 1 candy of their type, or heal / revive / evolve them if you want to continue to use them.

**There are 2 ways i've found to revive your Pokemon**

* Using the revive (yellow) potion from your items - restores Pokemon to half health
* Evolving your Pokemon - revives and gives them full health


##How do i get healing / revive potions?

* You get these potions as rewards from pokestops.  Its random chance whether you get pokeballs, potions or a mix of both.  

* The items you get from a pokestop are based on your level, so you will only start getting potions once you get above level 5.

* You also get some when you level up at certain levels, but that takes time obviously.

##Turning your unwanted Pokemon into candy

If you have decided that a Pokemon is no longer a use, you can turn them into 1 candy of their type.  To do this, do the following:

* click on the Pokeball 
* click on Pokemon 
* click on the Pokemon you want to convert 
* scroll down and hit the ""transfer"" button
* You will lose the Pokemon to the professor and he will give you 1 candy of their type in exchange.


#How do Eggs work?

##What are these Eggs people are talking about

* Eggs are items that will hatch a Pokemon after you have walked a specified distance.  But the only egg that will count the distance being walked is the egg in the incubator.

##Where do i find eggs?

* I have only received eggs as rewards from pokestops.  Its just a random chance.

##Starting the incubation process

* As soon as you find your first egg, you need to add it to the incubator ASAP.  If you dont add the egg to the incubator, its not doing anything and not progressing to hatching.

##How do i get an egg into an incubator?

* Click on the pokeball
* Goto ""Pokemon""
* Up the top right, there is a tab called ""EGGS"" - click that
* Tap the Egg you want to hatch (the longer the distance required, the better chance of getting better Pokemon)
* Press the ""Start Incubation"" button
* Select a free incubator - everyone starts with 1 incubator that never expires.  You can buy / find incubators that expire after 3 uses (so you catch be incubating multiple eggs at a time).

##How is distance registered in the app?

* For distance to register, you need to have the app open and running.  If you minimise it or lock your phone or anything, the distance you walk will not count.  There is a ""Battery Saver"" mode that will black out the screen but keep the app active which does record distance correctly and saves battery.

* Their is a max speed where if you travel faster then that, any distance travelled will not count.  For instance, being on a train with the app open will only record the slow parts of the trip (arriving and leaving a train station).  The fast parts dont count.

* Some goes with driving obviously, I've been told the speed limit is 60kmph, but i've only tested myself at 20kmph which works fine.  So doing a lap of your local gyms, late at night, doing 20kmph, will count as walking.  I'll try confirm the max speed at some point.  I tried 40kmph and it didnt register - so the max speed is between 20kmph and 40kmph.

* Just so its clear, yes the app needs to be running an open for any walking distance to count.  Riding too fast on a bike can also cause distance not to count.  Best to check your phone after travelling for a bit to see if the distance is being recorded and adjust accordingly.

##What happens once you have walked the distance required by and egg?

* You will get a full screen message with a picture of the egg.  Tapping the egg starts the hatching process after a bit of an animation

##If i walk while i'm trying to capture a wild pokemon, does that distance count?

* Yes - i did a  1km test of this.  Basically started a wild capture, walked 1km , then captured the pokemon - my egg registered the 1km that i walked.  So no need to stop completely to capture a wild pokemon (unless there are multiple around and you want to catch them all).

##What rewards do you get from the egg?

* Well you get a random Pokemon obviously, but you also get quite a bit of stardust and candy.  For instance, i hatched my 10km egg tonight and i got an Omanyte, 2701 Stardust and 27 Omanyte Candy.  Rewards for getting fit, hard to complain.

##Whats the difference between an egg with a bigger distance to unlock?##

* After hatching multiple 10km, 5km and 2km eggs, i can confirm that the eggs that take longer to hatch give better rewards.  There is always a random element to it, but you get stronger Pokemon, more candy and more dust in the eggs that require more distance.

##Can you only hold 9 Eggs at a time?

* Yes - so you will stop getting egg drops from the Pokestop once you have 9 eggs.  So you need to incubate those eggs as soon as possible if you are full so you have a chance to get a 10km Egg.

#Evolving Pokemon

##How does evolving work?

* Certain Pokemon can be evolved to stronger forms of themselves.  To do this, you need to pay between 6 and 400 (lol) candy.  Typically, it costs 50 candy to evolve a Pokemon to their final form.

##What happens to the pokemon's Combat Power (CP) when it evolves?

* The way CP works is that each Pokemon has a max CP.  If you click on the pokemon, at the top you will see a semi circle with a percentage of it white.  The more white the semicircle line is, the more CP you have.  

* So when the Pokemon evolves, the % of the CP semi circle that they have filled stays the same, but because the evolved version of the Pokemon has a higher max CP, the pokemon will have more CP after they evolve.

* Since the current CP that the pokemon has does not effect the cost of evolving, you should try and evolve the pokemon who is closest to having a full CP semi circle.

##When a pokemon evolves, do their skills change?

* Yes - well they dont always but they can.  This is why if you are looking to min/max your pokemon, you wont know if you got the perfect pokemon until they have evolved to their final form.  This is one reason why its recommended to not power up any pokemon until they are fully evolved (so you dont waste dust / candy)

##Is there a difference between powering up before or after evolving?

* No - The cost stays the same and the % of the bar that is filled each time you power up is the same.  So its better to get the pokemon to their final form before you power them up.  So focus on evolving the pokemon, and if you deem it a good pokemon after they are fully evolved, spend you candy and dust on powering them up.

##Why does Magikarp take 400 candy to evolve?

* Magikarp is one of the weakest Pokemon who then morphs into one of the strongest.  So to simulate the fact that he is soo weak and takes a long time to level up in the original Pokemon games, he is given a high number of candy to evolve causing you to take a long time to get enough to evolve him.

* If you are wondering what he looks like, hes the Pokemon that shows on the ""Loading"" screen that you should all be familiar with by now :)

##Should i evolve X Pokemon?

* Evolving takes a different amount of candy depending on the type of Pokemon.  I'm a hoarder in games so i have a hard time spending my currency, but i would only recommend evolving a fairly strong Pokemon.  I think its better to hold onto the candy until you have a decent Pokemon before evolving.

* I would also not spend candy on powerup's until the Pokemon is max ""evolution"" as it just delays how quick you can build up your Pokemon.  I didn't see an increase in the ""Power Up"" cost after evolving so i dont think you need to consider powering up before evolving.

* The evolved Pokemon uses the same candy as the un-evolved Pokemon

* The only difference between evolving a high CP Pokemon and a low CP Pokemon, is that you need to spend more dust/candy to ""Power Up"" the low CP Pokemon after its been eveolved.  So it will just save you dust and candy if the Pokemon you evolve has the highest CP you can find.

#Pokemon Size (XL vs XS) - The differences

##Does the size of the Pokemon effect the stats? (i.e. XS vs XL)

* YES - from my testing, it seems that XS Pokemon will end up with more CP but less HP then the XL version.  I have tested this using multiple pokemon i.e. Powering Up pokemon that are the same CP but different sizes and seeing how it effects there upgraded stats and comparing 2 pokemon that have the same CP but different sizes and comparing their HP and the distance of the semi circle that has been filled in.

* So the smaller the pokemon, the more CP you are going to end up with, but you'll have less HP - I've listed some examples below.

##Caterpie Example

I've included an image of 2 Caterpie that i have that have similar Combat Power but have different HP and a different percentage of the Combat Power line filled in.  Basically, the smaller Caterpie has less of the Combat Power line filled in (which means you can Power it up more) but it already has more CP then the bigger Caterpie.  However, it has almost 25% less HP.

#Player Level

##Player Level is King

* I wrote a post with more detailed info on how player level effects the game and why i deem it important.  You can read it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4sb61f/player_level_is_king_focus_on_xp_leveling/

##Does my player level effect the wild pokemon that spawn?

* Yes, the higher the level, the stronger the wild pokemon that spawn seem to be.  So i would definitely look to focus on leveling up the player.

##Does my player level effect items i get from the pokestops?

* Yes - as your level increases and passes certain points, you start getting different items at the pokestops.  For instance, once you hit level 12, you start getting great pokeballs.   

#Candy

##How do you get candy?

You can get candy through a few different means:

* Everytime you catch a pokemon, you get 3 candy of their type.  This is why i recommend catching every pokemon you see - for the candy and dust.

* You can ""transfer"" a pokemon to the professor and he will give you 1 candy of the type of pokemon that you transfer - but you lost the pokemon permanently obviously.

* When you hatch an egg, you get quite a lot of candy of the type of pokemon that hatched.  For intance, i got 27 candy from 1 egg hatch.  Note that the longer the distance required to hatch the egg, the more candy it rewarded.

##What is candy used for?

The main purpose of candy is to power up and evolve your pokemon.  

* Evolving your pokemon only requires candy of the same type of pokemon - typically it costs around 50 candy (each pokemon is different).

* Powering up your pokemon increases the amount of CP that they have and it will cost 1 - 2 candy plus stardust.

#Stardust

##How do you get Stardust?

There are a few ways to get stardust - the most common will be to catch Pokemon.

* Each Pokemon caught will grant 100 stardust and 3 candy of the caught Pokemon type
* You can get stardust from leveling up your character
* You get stardust once per day from the ""shop"" - for each Pokemon you have in a gym, pressing the shield icon in the top right will give you 500 dust - up to a max of 5000.

##What is Stardust used for?

* Stardust is used to power up your pokemon.  It requires dust + candy to power up your pokemon and its going to be the dust that limits your pokemon progress.  So you want to get as much dust as possible.

#Pokestops

##What are pokestops for?

* Pokestops are where you can collect various items that you need to catch and heal your pokemon.  You get between 3 and 7 items each time you activate a pokestop.  Getting 5 or less items on the Pokestop will get you 50XP, 6 or more will get you 100xp.

##Does your level effect the items you get from a pokestop?

* Yes - as you hit certain levels, you start getting different items appearing.  So you want to try and level up your player as a priority.

##I've clicked on the pokestop on the map and it shows an image in a circle, now what?

* To activate the pokestop, simply swipe your finger across the circle image so it spins - and out will pop the items.

* You DONT have to click on each item once its spawned by the pokestop, just click the ""X"" and it will close the screen and pickup all items - save those extra few seconds :)

##Why are some pokestops pink?

* Pink pokestops are ones that you have already visited and you cant activate them again until they turn blue.

##How long does it take for a pokestop to turn back to blue?

* 5 minutes - so if you have an area with a few pokestops, you can just do laps of them to collect items and catch pokemon.  There is no limit to the number of times you can activate a pokestop in the same day.

##A Pokestop looks like a party is happening on it (Lots of petals showering it), what is that about?

* If someone uses a lure on a pokestop, it looks like its throwing a party.  This causes pokemon to spawn at the pokestop that may be from a different area completely.  If you have the time and you are looking for pokemon, its worth hanging around these pokestops to catch pokemon (especially if there is a few in the same area).

#Pokemon Combat Power

##What does CP of a Pokemon mean

* CP is the combat power of the Pokemon, the higher the CP , the stronger the Pokemon.

* You can increase CP by Powering Up your Pokemon (it can only go as far as the semicircle line above your Pokemon - once its full white, thats it).

* You can also increase your CP by evolving the Pokemon - which converts it into the next evolution of the Pokemon which comes with increased CP


#Inventory Tips

##My Bags Are Full, What should i do?

* You have to either buy more bag space or delete some items.  For the team, i pressed the ""bin"" icon on my pokeballs and hoped that it didn't delete them all - it didn't, it asked me how many i wanted to delete so i could throw away 30.

##My Bags are full, what happens when i goto a pokestop?

* If your bags are full and you visit a pokestop, you wont get ANY items but you will still get the XP

##My bags are full, what happens if i level up?

* If your bags are full and you level up, you get ALL the items that are rewarded for that level, and you bag will be ""over capacity"".  So you will need to use / delete items until you have space.  But its good that they allow you to go over capacity in this instance.

#Incense Item

##What does Incense do?

* Using Incense will make it active for 30 mins from that time - even if you are offline.  I used an Incense, got booted from the server, and when i finally got back in, it was down to 15 mins.

* I saw a slight increase in number of wild Pokemon that popped up, but i was expecting more - hard to tell how much it does though.  

* Using Incense will make a pink swirly cloud appear around you

#Lure item

##What does a Lure do?

* You use a lure on a pokestop and it causes pokemon to spawn at it.  These pokemon may not normally spawn in the area without a lure.

* Lures last for 30 mins and they work for all players.  So its worth hanging around a pokestop with a lure on it if you have the time.

#Login Tips

##I hate having to enter my email in again, any tips for this?

* I save my email to my clipboard so atleast i only have to enter my password when it happens.

* But, the best way to prevent this is to actually close the app if it looks like its timing out.  For instance, when you try to login, the first section of the progress bar is all about confirming your account on the pokemon servers.  If the bar doesn't progress after 5 seconds, close the app.  When you re-open it, it will attempt the login again - rinse and repeat until you are logged in.

* Your settings are only wiped if you get to that ""our servers are busy, try again"" screen.  So if you kill the app before it gets there, you dont need to re-enter the login details.

#Troubleshooting Stuff

##I'm stuck on the pokeball screen after just getting a Pokemon - help

* Unfortunately, i have not recovered from this screen.  I've left it for 5 mins but it never moved on - i have always had to restart the game in which case i lost the Pokemon i just caught.  Though it seems sometimes you get to keep the Pokemon - either way, restart and hope for the best.

##I just started a gym battle but its stuck before it shows my pokemon - Help

* This happens every now and then when you try and start a gym battle, if the screen stops moving for more then 5 seconds, you need to restart the app and just restart the gym battle.

##Restarting is your friend

* To go along with the above, anytime you are getting stuck, i've found it better to just restart the app as i have not recovered from any ""stuck"" screen.

##Battery Saver Mode

* Recommend you turn this on , click the pokeball -> click top right settings -> then activate the battery saver mode.  It means while the phone is upside down, the screen will turn off but everything else still runs.  Just hold onto the phone with earphones in and it will vibrate when a wild Pokemon is near or make a noise when you get in range of a pokestop.

* Upside down = the TOP of the phone is pointing to the ground and the BOTTOM of the phone is pointing to the sky. This will make the screen black apart from a faint Pokemon Go logo (provided your phone has a gyro).

* Flipped = The SCREEN is facing the ground and the BACK OF THE PHONE is pointing to the sky - this does nothing and wont activate battery saver mode.

* Note: when i went to demo this, the app had turned off my setting and i had to turn it back on.  So just double check your setting is enabled if its not working for you.

##Augmented Reality (AR) Mode

* You can turn off AR mode when you are catching Pokemon and i RECOMMEND you do it.  When you are in an area with people or late at night, having someone point their phone at people and ""swipe"" on it looks sooo dodgy.  When you are in the Pokemon catch screen, at the top right is an AR switch, just toggle it and you can safely point your phone at the ground and catch those Pokemon.  AR mode is cool, but it makes you look creepy in certain circumstances.

##Those 1 Handed Pokemon Go Players Who Use Their Thumb

* Due to the way our hand is built, when you try and catch Pokemon one handed with your thumb, it naturally will curve the pokeball throw.  Just offset this curve by rotating your phone in your hand a bit so that when you swipe with your thumb, it goes dead centre.

* Alternatively, use 2 hands and just swipe straight with the other hand :) 

##My AR and Battery saver settings keep resetting - why?

* When you get the screen to login with Google, it seems like the app wipes your local settings.  Actually the wiping probably happens before you get the Google login and the login token is part of the local settings that are wiped.  Either way, once you get that login screen showing, all your local settings are gone.

I've played Ingress beforehand to get a better grasp of the concept of an augmented reality game, so I already knew which spots would be Pokemon infested and which spots would be Pokestops/Gyms. In my neighborhood, there's currently one Gym (currently inhabited by a Pinsir) and 3 - 4 Pokestops. Overall, it's good enough for me, the only problem being that the Pokestops are a tad bit too far for me to casually walk to regularly. There's a town hall and a basketball court nearby which would make excellent Pokestops, but for some reason, they aren't. I'm not sure how I would go about reporting these locations as potential stops, since I faintly recall being able to do the same in Ingress.

Anyway, recently, there's been news of Pokestops being removed for no apparent reason in certain places (such as [public libraries](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4we4su/removal_of_pokestops_is_becoming_pretty_ridiculous/). The most unusual cases are when the authorities of the locations had absolutely no problems with the game, and in some cases even welcome the flooding attention. The most reasonable explanation would be some people decided to report these Pokestops as being ""problematic"" (even though there is no apparent issue in the first place). 

This got me thinking; if it's this easy to remove a stop, then shouldn't it be as easy to add a new one? I know Niantic kinda has their hands full at the moment, but in the future, they should allow us to give suggestions for new Gyms or Pokestops. If that's too easy, then they should allow us to vote for them as well so that we don't see random Pokestops being placed in random places.",1470519457.0

If only Niantic had been a little more communicative, a little more patient, developed a little more content before releasing the game (and eventually releasing it according to better crafted events), this game would still be going strong.

It really saddens me that despite the fact that we are able to come up with such a concept once in a decade or so, and the company can't even be considerate enough to LISTEN to the player base. To all the aspiring game developers reading this, communication is a highly underrated activity.

It is SO important to actually let the players know what's going on on the other side when an app is having problems. Heck, Duel even has a dedicated in-app section that informs us of updates.

It makes the world of a difference to actually go out of the way and play your part as a developer first. It's not likr Niantic urgently needed sponsors right?

Ideas such as Pokemon GO are rare. Record-breaking rare. It really saddens me as a gamer to see such unprofessional execution from Niantic.

During my walk I noticed a really heavy set girl (about 250 pounds) sitting on a bench at a pokestop sweating her ass off (she must of been walking a lot, and it was hot out today). I saw her try and talk to some people (2 guys and a girl) who were obviously playing the game and they just walked past her like she was no one. After seeing this I walked up to the stop, said ""hey, you playing pokemon?"" to which she smiled and said yes. I then said ""Is it ok if I take a seat? My name is Brady."" She smiled again and said she would like that. So we talked for a couple of minutes, and she told me she never played pokemon as a kid, but when she heard of this game she figured she would try it because she wanted to lose weight and make friends. So I asked why she was sitting at the stop and she said she had been walking for 3 hours (she had one of those portable battery cases), and that she wanted to take a break because it was hot and she was tired. I then asked if she had a lure or incense so she could catch pokemon while sitting at the stop. She said she doesn't have a lot of money and she used up her only 2 incense that she started with. So I decided to pop a lure at the stop so she could catch pokemon on her break. She was very happy and asked to add me on facebook and told me that I had made her day. I now have a new friend to go pokemon hunting with.

Moral of the story, some people are playing the game to lose weight and make friends, please don't give them a hard time for it, you don't have to befriend them, but at least be friendly.

Some NPCs would battle you and you would be rewarded some PokeCoins. 

Others would give you quests like ""catch x amount of water pokemon in y number of hours."" 

And others could be travel: ""could you drop this off at 'NAME OF POKESTOP OR GYM' for me?""

Someone could ask you to hatch a certain number of eggs in some amount of days.

I’ve been playing Pokémon Go for like 2 years, my wife has always tolerated my playing but always made fun of me for doing it. The teasing was almost always in good nature. I always told her that If she started playing she’d enjoy it, but she always said no.

She decided that she wanted to get her Masters in Architecture and we moved across the country in July. It’s been hard adjustment. she has never lived more than a few hours from home, and we were both living in the city we finished undergrad in so we had a ton of friends, good jobs, family close by all that good stuff.

The week before school started I needed to make a new friend for a research objective and we were laying in bed so I grabbed her phone and made her an account and added myself as a friend. I showed her how to catch Pokémon and the very basics of the game and we went to sleep. The next night I look over and she is playing on her own! She said she had went to pokestops all day around campus and was catching tons of Pokémon. Her favorite was the fire dog (growlithe lmao). 

Then a few days into the new semester we got a phone call, her uncle had been killed in action overseas. Her uncle was a AMAZING guy. So nice, kind, gentle, and insanely smart. You never would have known he was a super bad ass military guy. The two of them had been really close. He was only 8 years older than us, he would pick her up from school all the time, always made an effort to make it to her dance competitions. Even with how busy they are as adults they still would talk on the phone a few times a month. 

The death has hit her super hard. She went to Delaware to be there when the body arrived and two weeks later we went to Seattle for the funeral. All while she is trying to keep up on her pretty demanding school schedule. 

She has basically been a shell of herself for the past few weeks. BUT amazingly one of the only things that makes her smile is talking about and playing Pokémon Go.  

Yesterday was particularly rough, she was saying how guilty she felt still, she feels so lonely being so far from her family, she is angry at no one in particular. She feels bad because she feels like she should be over it by now. She has no energy or desire to get her work done. It was a sad conversation. I’m trying to be supportive but I also feel at a loss. 

A few hours later she asks if we can go play Pokémon, so we get in the car to go do a MewToo raid. It was her first 5 start raid and within 2 seconds of the raid starting she was cheering and smiling and having a super great time. It was so relieving and great to see her so genuinely happy. 

Thank you for reading this far. This is such a great game and great community.


Hey thank you so much everyone for your positive comments and stories. They really meant a lot to both of us!

But now it dawned on me that the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act might come into play....if Niantic is sharing user data with the sponsors as part of the deal.

814,Hey kids - Please stop making fun of overweight people who are playing...,9213,4t1f1i,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t1f1i/hey_kids_please_stop_making_fun_of_overweight/,779,"Hey there,



Part time basketball coach here who works with 11-15 year olds during the school year. I am some one who really tries hard to motivate kids to get out and exercise, so I think Pokemon Go is a great game for this - especially during the summer!



I have seen so many kids out running around and capturing Pokemon, some even going on epic walking quests to fight at gyms, stop at PokeStops, and of course catch Pokemon. It is awesome! 



I have also seen some not so nice stuff, like kids snickering about ""fat kids"" trying to get out and use the game to exercise. And that is just so uncalled for... Grow up, seriously. I want to assume that 99.9% of the people on this sub-reddit are good people, but if you have done this, then you need to GTFO and find a different hobby. I pipe up and say something every time I hear this. And sadly it has been a few times... 



Today while I was playing, I saw a chubby kid getting picked on. A bunch of brats were saying ""hey look, a Snorlax"" but of course, it was just the kid they were pointing at. The part that pissed me off was the over weight boy was looking around for the Snorlax before he realized they were talking about him. After I chewed the bratty kids out, I sat down with the boy and told him to keep up the good work and to not let it get to him. He admitted that playing Pokemon Go motivated him to get out and try and exercise like nothing else has, and he would not let the bullies bug him. He did not play sports, and he was scared of a ""real"" gym, so he decided that this could be his ticket and he was averaging hatching a 2 km egg every day!! This is really impressive for some one who does not get out much. 


I put a lure down where we were sitting and we had some fun catching Pokemon for a bit. Eventually one of the brats came over to use our lure and I told him he could not join unless he would apologize. So he did and we all ended up having some fun. Those two boys ended up even having a pleasant conversation. We got a bunch more people around our lure, and I could tell it really made this boy's day... 



Guys, Pokemon Go is doing something special. It is getting anti-social kids, and over weight people out and about and we need to applaud them for that. I enjoy talking to all the kids and people playing about the game and sharing tips and tricks. Or of course, Pokemon locations.



Realize that other people, even the chubby ones, will want experience making friends while playing and a kid who never has exercised before and is finally using this as a tool to better himself needs to be applauded, not shunned back into hiding. So please, make friends out there and if you see an over weight person (especially if they are alone), go have a little chat... Don't even mention their weight, just treat them normally and end the convo with ""happy hunting""... This is a social game and it will mean a lot and keep them motivated.



Thanks for listening. Good luck fellow trainers!

You'll throw like 10 balls before 1 actually hits them sometimes. The trick is turn on your AR. Aim your phone so they are at the bottom of the screen. Then you'll be able to reach them with a regular throw. 

Forgive me if this is common knowledge but I've been on this sub for months and never knew about this until today. 

I went through 30 ultra balls and 25 great balls before I tried this trick today. It totally works.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

Edit the Second: And thanks for the silver, too, other kind stranger!

Edit 2.5: I'm blown away by the response to my little post, and I imagine the response isn't so much about my killer hatch as it is about how great it is that so many different sorts/ages of people like Pokemon Go. So many words of comfort and affirmation, though! I agree, everyone should do what makes them happy no matter what others think, but I assure you I'm not ""ashamed"" or self-conscious about playing the game. In fact, I'm a totally confident grown-ass man who's also sort of a goofball. So I suppose ""silly"" in the title was a bad word choice; I just thought it fit well with ""giddy"" (though I did feel kinda silly and giddy as I skipped over to my kid's room to brag about my shiny new shiny).

Ninja Edit 2.6: Someone pointed out this one probably wasn't from a Portugal egg because it says ""San Diego"". I received two other Mr. Mimes from the Portugal friend recently and I just assumed this one was, too -- especially since Mr. Mime is supposed to be regional, but upon closer inspection it turns out this was indeed a 5km local egg. Weird?

Yet Another Edit: And thanks to the other kind stranger for the platinum. Y'all are awesome. :)",1568789678.0

She just got Let's Go Eevee to play while I play games on my PC so she was excited about catching more outside.  She's also been going through a unicorn phase (don't ask questions) and really wanted to catch a Ponyta so she could evolve it. There was one nearby so we set out to catch it.

We arrived at the pokestop and I proceeded to catch mine. I asked her how it's going with her and she responded ""I got it. Look honey, this one has blue fire, how cool."" 

THE ONE POKEMON SHE WANTED AND IT WAS A SHINY AFTER ONLY A DAY OF PLAYING (not to mention she didn't even comprehend how lucky she was). 

Anyways, I was happy for her and we moved on. Next day, there was an Eevee nearby...you can probably already tell where this is going. We proceeded to catch them and...

""Hey this one has stars by it just like my Ponyta""

So within two days of playing, she caught her two favorite Pokemon and both were shiny's. I don't know what she's doing, but I'm onto her.

Anyways, gg Niantic. You've made her stupidly happy

I tell people this up front when they meet me, not to expect things. (By meet, I normally mean online, safely behind my PC)

Over the years my lonerism has gotten worse and worse. With that, I'm sure my gloomy nature is more than just that, but I haven't seen a doctor so I won't say I have anything wrong with me. 

As to not make this a dreadfully long post, I'll sum up that I went from outgoing, semi-fit to not caring what I eat, wear, look like (For the most part). I stopped being excited for anything that was outside the borders of my home. That is, until I found out about Pokemon Go.

I've recently downloaded it and the first few hours, I sat there, staring at my character and then glancing outside. Wanting to, but afraid to actually go. Today, I went. And I didn't plan on going very far, there was a pokestop closeby and I thought that'd be a good start. 

It felt so liberating to walk there, with a sense of purpose I've not felt in 10 years. (That's how long I've been sitting at home)
I kept walking and went to two more pokestops. I only caught two pokemon but I loved every second of it. I smiled the entire way that I thought I'd share that with a bunch of people that I don't know.

Maybe, perhaps, a few of you are also excited but afraid. Hopefully, you'll take the same step I did. I promise you won't regret it. (Unless you don't look left 'n right before crossing with your phone infront of your face.)",1467922721.0

894,[DISCUSSION] Pretty please can the egg hatching speed be raised to include normal human running speeds? 10.5km/h (~6.5 mph) is REALLY slow... 14kph/~8.5mph would be more than reasonable.,8765,5vzk38,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/5vzk38/discussion_pretty_please_can_the_egg_hatching/,654,"It's clear Niantic has been listening to our feedback, and this is something I really feel needs attention, especially considering how easy it would be to implement and how much of a positive impact it would have for a significant portion of the player base. Anyway.

I love this game. I also love running. And you'd think this would be a perfect pair of things to love. But anything more than a shuffle means not being able to hatch eggs. If I run at my normal pace, I'm lucky if the app tracks any distance at all, and this is frustrating, especially since this is a fitness-oriented game. It feels like being punished for becoming more fit. 


I understand they don't want us playing while driving. But a difference of a couple kms/h isn't going to do much to prevent that. It does, however, have a significant negative impact on the legitimate players who run, which I don't think is the intention. 


**So I submit that there is no good reason the egg hatching speed couldn't be raised to a reasonable 14kph/8.5mph.** Of course faster would be even better (that opens up biking! And who wouldn't love motivation to run even faster! Hooray interval workouts!), but even a change this small would be a HUGE quality of life upgrade for a significant portion of the player base. 


And this change would also benefit Niantic!  Faster egg hatching = more incubator sales!  :D ---> $$$ 

Honestly you guys, this change seems like all upside:

* **Trivially easy to implement** 

* **Negligible downside**

* **Huge quality of life upgrade for a significant portion of the player base (this is a fitness-oriented game, after all)**

* **More motivation to keep increasing fitness**

* **Increase incubator sales**

If there is any extra incentive needed, I'd be willing to pet my dog eight thousand times for each kph the speed limit increases. 

Think about it, Niantic. Think how happy my dog will be.

I felt ridiculous driving out there, I thought ""maybe there will be a few people doing the same and I won't look so odd."" As I drove down the main downtown street I saw them.


Herds of people of all types out in the streets yelling out what pokemon were where. There were HUNDREDS of people outside the bars. More outside than in! When I parked I realized the 3 most popular bars were all pokestops...and they all had lures. I hung out there for about an hour then just sat back and watched what 10 year old me could only dream of. I watched people who would never interact with each other strike up friendships, I saw old and young people comparing what they had caught, people out on dates, people coming out of the bars to catch something then go back in.


At one point someone yelled ""THERE'S A RHYDON IN THE STREET!"" and from my position I could see 50+ people all turn their cameras in the same direction to reveal the beast. For a moment there WAS a huge stony rhinoceros in the middle of downtown. It was real.

960,Guys....we need to admit that maybe PoGo isn't the best game to play during a pandemic.,8401,fnkui9,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/fnkui9/guyswe_need_to_admit_that_maybe_pogo_isnt_the/,445,"I keep seeing all these posts complaining about free incense but no balls, and how greedy Niantic is, and all these features they could add to make it better for quarantined people. But the truth is that this game is **fundamentally** based on walking to achieve goals. Eggs, balls, Pokemon, items, are all acquired by walking. Even the gifts that you give each other come from walking around and spinning pokestops.

**I'm not saying we should all stop playing,** I'm still planning on catching some good boys when I go out for groceries and stuff. But just keep in mind that this game isn't designed for your lifestyle if you're stuck at home. In order to fix that, Niantic would have to change the game **entirely**, and we probably wouldn't like it all that much.

So maybe just accept the fact that PoGo isn't going to be one of your daily activities for the next month or two, and try out [another mobile game](https://pokemonmasters-game.com/en-US) that might work better while you're stuck at home.

**EDIT:** Looks like they added some free balls. Neat! But I still don't think it makes the game fun or quarantine-friendly. I'll probably keep playing, but much less than I did before. And I might unsubscribe from this subreddit if it continues to go the way it has been (mostly complaining and demanding new features for the pandemic).",1585002496.0

So, i had a 3 day job at a school, I've never been to, so I was unaware of the culture and the students.

The kids introduced themselves, and had to come up with a ""fun fact"" about themselves. One kid mentioned he plays Pokemon Go. As an avid player myself (lvl 40, 100+ shinies etc.), I said ""how cool is that?!"" where one of them asked me if i played.
 
I said, ""yes"". 

The kids went absolutely mental. Apparently, PoGo is becoming popular again, and the school is in this rural area with very few stops. They all (the PoGo players) wanted to be my friend, and asked me for trades to remember me, and we talked about the game, I showed my shinies and legendaries, they showed theirs and everything.

Today was my last day, and I traded with all of them, because they wanted to have something to remember me by. I also promised to open and send gifts everyday.

That's how i got 11 new friends, and became either ""the cool teacher"" or ""the dorky teacher who plays a childs game"". Either way, was awesome.

EDIT: First of all. Thank you for the gold!! Means a lot, really. Also, yeah, i agree Pokémon isn't a child game, but it kinda have a reputation where I'm from, that it's ""for kids"". Which is stupid because a lot of adults play it too!

EDIT 2: On my way home today the shiny Gods smiled to me. I caught a shiny Swablu and 3 minutes later a shiny Mr. Mime appeared. My first shinies in a while (not counting CD).

Also, thanks for all the comments. :)

Final edit: Thanks for all your kind responses. I graduated in June and have been looking for a job ever since. Your positive posts about me as a Teacher is so life confirming and I am deeply touched. Thanks to every single one of you. Really.

And thanks for people looking out for me. I will be more thoughtful about connecting in the future.",1574982969.0

I live close enough to have 6 or 7 gyms on my nearby but where I am, the pandemic is still bad and it also gets dark before 5pm. This time of year especially, remote passes are ideal so I can raid safely - I have only completed 2 raids since they stopped offering the weekly remote pass. If I can’t go out to raid, I also can’t go out to put pokemon in gyms so I can afford passes. They already give us a free daily pass, why not let us get a free remote pass weekly? Even better, why not make the free daily pass remote? I’m super frustrated, especially when my research goals & leveling past 40 require raiding. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way, I just hope we can bring more and more attention to this so that someone at Niantic will make a change.",1608531919.0

The officer I spoke to was a super awesome guy. He told me that the officer from the night before was *confused* on the situation. He informed that he was familiar with the game. Told me no comment on whether he played or not, but that he had played Ingress when it was popular on campus. I was told we could play anytime we wanted as long as we didn't do anything illegal. Which is how it should be. He gave me his name to use if we had any issues and offered his hand to shake. As I walked out he said ""Good luck bro.""

He also had the dopest mustache. 


The college campus I live on, blah blah blah is about to have a *riot* on their hands. One campus officer took it upon himself to try and kick everyone playing Pokemon Go off campus. The majority of us are students and live here. The officer was doing this because two men tried to break into a building, got caught and used the excuse that they were trying to catch a Pokemon. This is absurd. I tried to reason with the officer saying there's no campus policy stating we cant walk around campus hours. There's no policy saying we can't play phone games. Tomorrow a bunch of us PKgo players are going to campus PD to complain about this officer. 

I really hope we don't see a lot of criminal activity trying to be passed off as people playing Pokemon and give this game a bad name. 

FOR ANYONE INTERESTED: I have a [slack](https://slack.com) team for Pokemon GO. It's mostly locals but I will create channels for any region. We have private channels set up for each team. Rare sightings channels. PM me for an invite :) 

Edit: thanks for the attention fellow trainers! Politics aye? I will post an update with how talking to the PD goes. Maybe someone there will be a little more sensible and not shove their maglite in my face. 

Edit2: Damn I wish my Pokemon CP was as high as this post's karma. College campus named. Please no hate mail. Let's be civil.
