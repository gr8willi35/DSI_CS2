6,Ideas for a Trainer Pass,0,mfyn9f,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mfyn9f/ideas_for_a_trainer_pass/,0,"I heard that Niantic was considering a ""pass royale"" sort of thing for Pokémon Go a while back, but it never seemed to have come to fruition. If they were to implement such a thing, here's what I'd want to see from it (And comment anything else you'd like to see).

1. More missions - 
Right now, you can only have three field research tasks in progress at a time (Not including the annoying AR tasks). If a pass were to be added, I'd like to see either an additional 2 or 3 slots for more tasks. Or, there could just be a page of tasks for all pass buyers each day (Like daily timed research).

2. More raids - 
Currently, you get one free in-person raid per day. I think with this pass, perhaps all passholders could get a daily free remote pass. An additional bonus could be that passholders can do any 1 star raid without a pass (Or they simply get a pass with infinite uses for 1 star raids)!

3. More egg hatching - 
Every player has one incubator that has infinite uses. I think giving those who buy the pass an additional infinite use incubator for the season would be another great help for players who are willing to pay and walk a lot. It might be too much to ask for, but maybe this second incubator could be a super incubator with infinite uses for the duration of the season (Trainer Pass Incubator?)

These are just a few of my ideas. I used to play a lot of Clash Royale and the season pass was a great addition to that game, and I think it would work even better in Pokémon Go. As for the price, I'd say $5 so that it's within the budget of as many players as possible. Comment your own ideas for a Go Pass if you have any!",2021-03-30 04:25:08

21,Gyarados is the best safe switch for ultra league premier cup season 7. Having trouble with venusaur or swampert then use gyarados to break those cores,0,mfvano,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mfvano/gyarados_is_the_best_safe_switch_for_ultra_league/,11,"Yo guys welcome back.

https://youtu.be/-RItRkICNTg

The team

Wing attack charizard, dragon claw &amp; blast burn
Dragon breath gyarados safe swap with aqua tail &amp; crunch
Mud shot shadow swampert, hydro cannon &amp; earthquake

Apologies for the difference in audio. I thought my mic was recording but it wasn’t 😩. Sadly budget iPhone audio will have to do therefore I’m sorry if some parts aren’t clear or there’s a little hissing or anything.

So I believe that Gyarados is the best safe switch in season 7. Yes! Even better than kingdra. So out of all the the most common safe swaps of Gallade, kingdra, Snorlax, Gengar, and drifblim. Kingdra is known as the best and gyarados beats it easily. It also has great coverage for venusaur and swampert. Although Gallade has better venusaur and swampert coverage, it’s less flexible higher up as you have to use shields to protect it whereas you don’t need to with gyarados and you can usually get your opponents Pokémon low and then farm down to have tonnes of energy on shadow swampert which is very strong.

Yes my team is weak to electric types due to the charizard lead but you can usually stay in and get a shield advantage. Once you come in with shadow swampert you have a lot of flexibility to win the game with a shield up.

This is a the team I used to hit legend in season 6 and it’s my comfort pick for this season also as it has great coverage and can handle xl teams appropriately.

Any losing match up you switch out to gyarados. Usually this will draw out the venusaur and you can get to an crunch and aqua tail before being taken down.  Gyarados can survive one frenzy plant so the dragon breath really chunks away.

The other notable thing is that double water is strong. Very strong as venusaur is the best response for most gyarados switch ins. This allows my shadow swampert to dominate the back line and also this team has a field day with xl Talonflame in the back.

So who do you think is the best safe swap for ultra league premier cup.

This is my personal opinion but I also have seen how versatile gyarados is and the ability to throw charge moves quickly gives it tremendous shield pressure. 

The aim of the team isn’t to win switch, if you can then great but it’s to get shields or to realign the team to your counters. Gyarados is a great meat shield and great pivot for this team.

Thank you. Who’s excited for the master league 😅.  I know I will be enjoy the great league ✌️",2021-03-30 01:54:56

27,Why cannot we get Mystery Components from grunts between leader encounters?,4,mftp57,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mftp57/why_cannot_we_get_mystery_components_from_grunts/,2,"I find this to be an extraordinarily frustrating part of the game and it really makes itself aware as a major problem during the level 44 tasks. I felt like so many grunt battles were a waste.

First, I had to do 100 grunt battles.

Then, I had to do 50 leader battles, which made the aforementioned quest moot since 50 leader battles requires 300 grunt battles.

But, the worst part is that once a Rocket Rader was activated, every grunt you encountered between that activation and finding a leader was a complete waste of time. Yeah, you had the grunt encounter. Great. But, if you battled it, yes, you would get credit for the 100 grunt task, but it would do you no good for progress on the 50 leader task because you did not get a Mysterious Component. So, it was always a complete waste of time and effort. You were going to have to battle another of the 300 needed AFTER you found the next leader.

What exactly is the problem with letting us stack Mysterious Components? It is not like getting a Radar is an easy task. I just do not understand the reasoning here and I think this is one of the most unfair aspects of the game. And, I still think we should be able to stack our free daily passes. But, this grunt situation is absolutely absurd.",2021-03-30 00:44:26

The previous super rocket radar was used during March, so I got my shadow Articuno with that, and have been holding on to the super rocket radar from ""The Higher They Fly"" since then so I could use that in April for the shadow Zapdos, use that month's in May for shadow Moltres, and hold on to May's super rocket radar for when they hopefully bring shadow Mewtwo back since I never got one of those.

But Niantic is making April's research only available for a week, so I'm wondering if I'll be able to do April's timed research despite not yet finishing ""The Higher They Fly"". If I will be able to do that, then it'd be nice because I'll be able to complete both sets of research with one super rocket radar.

I finally found and also fought Giovanni a few hours ago but sadly lost 2-3 times, I couldn’t get pass his second Pokémon without losing my whole team. I used a lot of different Pokémon like Sawk (2500 CP), Arcanine (2200 CP), Rayquaza (2100 CP), Tatonflame (2000 CP) and others. 

I already read through like 20+ posts in here and everybody is saying, that you should need to use Machamp, Kyogre, Lucario or Girantina but I don‘t have any of these nor do I have their first evolution. 

I used my Remote Raid Pass and caught a Poliwrath (1400 CP, 12/13/15, Mud Shot/Dynamic Punch) for Giovanni‘s first Pokémon. I could use some stardust and bring my Poliwrath to 2300 CP but I am scared that it‘s a waste and it‘s not gonna be worth it because I won‘t get a Lucario nor a Machamp as soon as possible.

Should I do it? Are there any more hints to win the fight? I really want an Articuno and I only got time till Wednesday for that, since there will be a Zapdos in April.

So i have been opening meltan boxes and hundo hunting for a better iv one for master league (my ML melmetal is 84% and i think im gonna give it to a friend once i get a hundo meltan) but its taking forever, ive been hunting long enough to have over 3000 meltan candy now and i caught a hundo metagross and wondered if metagross has any of the same generalist prawice of melmetal? It has lower bulk, more weaknesses. A fast move with worse energy generation, but also gets STAB bonus from most moves which is 20%, same as shadow bonus so it hits harder than melmetal.

I checked my inventory and I had a single remote pass. I guess they actually listen sometimes. 

I got an invite to a Rayquaza raid a little bit ago. I had one remote pass left, so I accepted. I was able to join in the lobby where there were 3 others as well. I joined with about 30 seconds before start, and we were all decent level, so I was down to run it with 4.

Once the raid actually starts, though, I'm the only one in there. I took a screenshot where you can clearly see there's no extra players anywhere around the stadium, and there's no player count under the timer. I backed out of the raid itself, but the lobby still shows 3 others in there as it would if the raid went off like it was supposed to.

I was about to contact support to see if I could maybe get my single raid pass back since it's my last one (even if I did, it'd probably be too late for the Rayq raids). They said they need screenshots of the journal, mine has absolutely no trace of the bugged raid at all. But my pass is surely nowhere to be found.

The screenshots I took of the raid/lobby when I noticed it was messed up were both taken within seconds of each other, and both have the same exact time stamp in the top left corner.

However, since Go Battle League uses an Elo system, it is a relative ranking: if the players in general, it becomes correspondingly harder to advance in ranks. That is, if most players played as well, or had as good Pokémon, as those who are at Rank 10 right now, then Rank 10 would become correspondingly harder to reach. By design, only a certain percentage of players can reach that rank.  I would bet that it is currently less than 5%. There is some variation between seasons, but not all that much.

So I was wondering if there was a way to just stop certain posts from appearing, like on Twitter how you can mute certain words or phrases so they don't show up in your timeline. I know you can hide a singular post but I wanted to know if there was a way to hide multiple similar posts of the same topic.

Not salty and genuinely happy for people but I really want to stop seeing the same post over and over again. Sorry if I cause anyone any offence, no intention.

*Update: I messaged the mod team to announce I was leaving because I recognise they work very hard so I wanted to personally reach out and explain why I was leaving and to thank them. I just got a response that, at least in my eyes, seemed a bit salty. It probably wasn't intended to be so, but it kind of felt that way. All for saying that I feel like this sub is kind of swamped by endless picture posting and humblebragging. After the response I got (which again, I'm sure I've probably misread) I feel confident leaving this community was the right thing to do. If this sub purely wants to allow itself to drown in the same post over and over each time a legendary event happens or there's a CD or someone happens upon a shiny then that's not my business but I just think there needs to be more balance. Anyway, none of this is my problem any longer, I just wanted to lay the matter to rest in my own way.

Yo guys welcome back.

Today I went through a world of hurt. I already knew it was going to be tough to get Metagross to work in the Ultra League Premier cup but I wasn’t ready for this kind of pain.

Shadow Metagross has no place in the ultra league! There are so many counters and shadow metagross is extremely glassy. It’s not worth it. Do not try this at home or waste your resources like me.

I tried to pair meta gross with empoleon to try the safest team comp of ABB with Gallade in the lead to farm the counters users but nope this team just couldn’t work due to the fact that meta gross can’t really tank much or take to much damage from anything.

I also tried it in the lead to see if it had any play but Nope. By the time you get to you meteor mash which will get shielded, you most likely won’t have enough health to get to the second. 

I’m not the best team builder so I tried to pair it with solid cores but I just couldn’t get it to work.

Has anyone tried metagross in the ultra league? Or should I say did anyone succeed with metagross?

Let me know what you think about shadow metagross.

Also which pokemon would you like me to try out next?

i’m at the point where i’m really only missing a few legendaries, so it’s really disappointing to know i have to wait another month or more to even get a new rotation, let alone the chance at something i actually need. for the life of me, i can’t figure out why we would need the incarnate forms again. it makes even less sense than the therian forms being 2 weeks each.  i’m already at the point where if i am able to raid, i’m just throwing balls away. cant even imagine how it’s gonna feel after another month and a half of this.

anyone else feeling the same or am i crazy?",2021-03-27 20:01:39

For community days it’s night and day when you have a weather boost rather than not having it, you get much more frequent spawns with higher cp and higher ivs. It’s unfair that some players can get a much better event experience because of something that’s completely out of their control. It would work great for events like this current one as well, where you can only encounter the featured shiny if you have rainy weather. This could even work well for big events like gofest, where the weather could change each hour to correspond with the current spawns. Don’t get me wrong, I love the weather boost feature, it brings a sense of immersion when the weather in-game is the same as the weather your playing in outside, but for some specific events I feel like event weather boosts would be a great implication.",2021-03-27 06:43:21

So focus blast does super effective to shadow balls only 2 weaknesses: dark and normal type giving excellent coverage and generalist capabilities. Sludge bomb on the other hand gets the STAB bonus and for those who dont know how important same type attack bonus is, it is the same as shadow bonus 20% and using it i can 2 shot an obstagoon and beat it with a decent shield or energy advantage due to it doing neutral so it works well as well. It also almost 1 shots xl charmers allowimg me to farm them the rest of the way down which is quite useful. so I havent had problems with xl umbreon suprisingly since nobody runs it in the back everyone who runs it runs it as a lead or so ive caught on to this and alolan muk which everyone runs in the back focus blast does neutral and since shadow ball is such a powerful move i can 2 shot an alolan muk with it, although thats a losing matchup that stops my sweep unless i have a good shield or energy advantage.

https://youtu.be/FbEuAmA2clg

Today the team is 
Shadow venusaur with vine whip, frenzy plant and sludge bomb
Empoleon with waterfall, hydro cannon and drill peck
Kingdra with dragon breath, octazuka and outrage

On my quest to build shadow Pokémon, I’ve finally have my shadow venusaur ready for the spotlight. 

Shadow venusaur is a boss. Venusaur is already one of the top Pokémon for ultra league and the shadow variant is just toxic. I love it.

Does shadow venusaur change any matchups, no not really. Frenzy plant is a busted move so this still plays like it’s regular version but deadly. Shadow frenzy plants hit harder, 20% harder 😅 but really they do and most commonly you will get a shield.

What it really gains is raw damage, hitting things harder and also doing more beaut real damage to its counters which softens them up for your back line.

The team performed phenomenally going 10/15 and therefore I can highly recommend it.  You don’t need it but if you want to have more fun then spam that frenzy plant.

Let me know if any of you guys have managed to build a team around shadow venusaur and let me know if you think the shadow variant is any better.

Thank you for watching and let me know what other Pokémon you want to see next.

I kicked out 3 of 6 mons until someone started to drown the last remaining 3 in golden berries.

Every time I've beaten them 2 times in a row, they would go back to full IV.

I took the challenge since I have more than enough healing items and I was wondering how much money they'd spend to earn 50 coins (they obviously spent real money on the game to do this).

After about 7 or 8 times they chugged berries into the remaining three, my phone was about to die, so I aborted.

I just hope the 24 golden berries were worth the 50 coins for the day.

I get it's implemented in the game and I can't necessarily blame them for making use of the feature, but damn that feels like an absolute dickmove.

If they were actually in the park with me, I would've probably broken their faces after the 7th try.

Anyway, that's my rant for this month. F*ck everyone doing this crap for over an hour.

If anyone does decide to give it a read, let me know if I missed anything, I've been playing basically daily for around 6 months now so I feel like I have a good handle on the game at least in the PVE side, but of course, that doesn't mean I have no blind spots.

I covered all of:

* hatching eggs,
* weather boost,
* Pokemon with permanently increased stardust on capture (i.e Trubbish gives 750.
   * Related, Audino gives 2.1k per capture when I looked into it... which is absurdly high, actually. Does anyone know why that is?
* using star pieces
* Daily catch bonus
* Battles
* and Gifts

Feeding berries at gyms also gets a mention for its 30 stardust a pop, but didn't really seem like it needed its own segment

443,Can we talk a little about how XL constantly changes the Ultra League?,0,mcvrxt,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mcvrxt/can_we_talk_a_little_about_how_xl_constantly/,9,"Hi,

For all purposes of the discussion, I am NOT an experienced player, i started to play in october, so a pretty new trainer. Still i reached lvl 34 in this interval of time, which i think is pretty good.

&#x200B;

However, i think the ultra league PVP is by far the toughest. Even if before you needed less candy for Ultra League than Master, now with all the XL pokemons, the meta (kinda) shifted from Great League to Ultra League and i think that it is kinda a poor decision, especially the change happening so fast.  

&#x200B;

I understand that the meta was kinda the same for a lot of time and the XL pokemons are a solution for that, but it just happens so fast that you can barely keep up with all the news of which pokemon gets an XL. It changed from barely changing to changing too quickly, and i don't think anyone can keep up with it. And a lot of pokemons that are XL might be overpoweeeeeered(just my opinion).

&#x200B;

Do you guys like the addition of XL pokemons so fast?

P.S:Also, having to put more candies into the Ultra League than the Master League is (kinda) counter-intuitive.",2021-03-25 19:11:50

Only been playing for a month (I spent most of the last decade living in a country where Pokemon Go is blocked so I never had a chance to get into it).

I,was doing fairly well in GBL Premier Cup - Not great, but I  made it to level 18 and could unlock most of the rewards. My line-up:

Donphan - Charm and Heavy Slam
Arcanine - Fire Fang and Wild Charge
Sawsbuck - Feint Attack and Megahorn

I know there are better Pokemon out there, but these are the ones I've invested in and grown attached to.

Anyway, once I saved up enough TMs, I decided to take the advice of [this website](https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/) and switch to each Pokemon's ideal movesets:

Donphan - Mud Slap and Earthquake
Arcanine - Fire Fang and Fire Blast
Sawsbuck - Feint Attack and Solar Beam

...Donphan's moveset was the hardest to get right because the TM gods seemed to want to give me anything *but* Mud Slap. I used up six TMs trying to get it.

Now all my charge moves are incredibly slow and I'm lucky if I can win even one match in a set. I'm kicking myself for listening to that website now. It's tough because GBL already triggers my anxiety a lot but I grind through it because I need the star dust.",2021-03-25 18:51:40

tap, 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 times before i get my shot off, my opponent launches their charge move and kills me.  i mean WTF?  the charge move was full of energy and ready to go.  
   
why doesn't the charge move fire as soon as the ball fills up?  
at the very least, it takes 2 taps to trigger it, but usually 3 to 5.  
i've lost 4 of my last battles because of this happens once or twice per round.  
is this a network lag thing?  
a game meta thing?  
i'm 99.8% certain this is *not* an exploit or cheat, but who knows.  
it's certainly not and RNG thing.

Since then, the movement gained massive traction across Reddit and also in mainstream media with articles in [Metro](https://metro.co.uk/2021/03/24/chaos-at-reddit-as-dozens-of-subreddits-made-private-in-protest-at-site-2-14297612/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348255/reddit-moderator-blackout-protest-aimee-knight-uk-green-party) amongst others.

I did some scrolling through here before posting to see what was up. Apparently AR Maps had something called groups? And now they don't exist anymore? Basically my question is, did they change the rewards today?

500,The Problems with Legendary XLs & Potential Solutions,2,mblkdo,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mblkdo/the_problems_with_legendary_xls_potential/,0,"XL Candy has gotten a lot of attention for how it has transformed Ultra League, but less attention has been paid to its effect on Master League. Master League has always been the least popular of the GBL leagues, and now that Niantic has allowed players to compete in Great League (either in specialized tournaments or the open meta) concurrently with Master League, it's less relevant than ever. 

However, maxed out Pokemon are still useful in battling Team Rockets, gyms, and Raids. While these environments have not yet been adjusted difficulty-wise to the new reality of Level 50 pokemon, it's not unthinkable that they will be at some point. Moreover, the reason players were less interested in Master League was because of the higher expense of stardust to compete, a concern that makes little sense when the lower leagues are now increasingly dominated by Level 50 mons that are almost as expensive themselves. It also makes very little sense for Niantic to continue a system in which the ""best"" pokemon are irrelevant.

Right now, maxing out a Legendary requires 296 XL candy for  normal pokemon, 360 XL candy for a shadow. With the recent changes to the XL system, you can get XL candy for Legendary in the following ways:

* Catch a Legendary: will Award at least 3 XL Candy
* Trade a Legendary.:This can only be done once a day, and works best with trades over 100 KM.
* Transfer a Legendary: Research is still being done on the odds here, but it is only a chance at a XL.
* Walk a Legendary: Again, you get a chance (Perhaps a good one based on the Level) if you walk 20 KM (""only"" 10 KM if your buddy is excited)
* Use Rare XL Candy: Currently only given out for leveling up past Level 4 and only a very few.

And...that's it. While, the trades, transfers, and walking are all nice methods, it's doubtful you can rely primarily on them to get to 296 (presuming legitimate methods anyway). This is especially true if you need to max out 3 pokemon or more, which is what you will need for Rockets or Master League (not to mention raids). The main method is going to be catching.

That's a problem. Let's be really generous and assume you could get half of the XLs needed by transfers, trades, and walking, players are still looking at around 50 raids. 8 free passes a week (assuming they continue one free remote a week, which is far from certain) can help, but even if the legendary is present in raids for a month, players are still forced to buy passes to get to the necessary amount. Moreover, we've seen less and less time for each legendary to be in raids. Players tend to get bored when a legendary lingers too long (recall the Kyurem griping in December), and when Therian Landorus is introduced we will have 42 different Legendary raids, not counting the various Deoxys forms or Genesect drives, and presumably there are more to come. Most legendaries are in and out in two weeks, requiring players to buy passes for the remaining 34 raids or more ( which translates to over $20 a pokemon using the current remote raid pass package, and again, that's generously assuming you're getting half of the XL candy from trades, transfers and walking)

That's a roundabout way of showing that under the current system, maxed out legendary pokemon are simply unattainable unless you spend a lot of money for passes.  This wasn't the case before; even if a pokemon was out of raids, raiding legendaries (and other things, like field research and GBL rewards) would still provide you with the rare candy you needed to power up that pokemon.

This is unsustainable. Niantic is going to have to choose between the current system, in which the legendary pokemon that are supposed to the best pokemon are mostly irrelevant, or make changes. There are a few options Niantic can do:

* Increase the amount of XL candy given on catch: 3 XL is good, but it can be better. Increasing the amount of XL given would automatically alleviate the issue, but I suspect Niantic may not be thrilled with the prospect of a single Meltan box giving all the requisite candy. It's a good idea, but unlikely.
* Decrease the walking distance for legendaries: 20 KM is hilariously high for a mere chance at a XL. Reducing it even to 10 KM would make walking legendaries for XL much more viable.
* Increase the availability of Legendaries in Raids: As I said earlier, we're at 42 different legendaries and counting. We're not far off from having a legendary for each week of the year. While Niantic has done certain groupings (Lati@s, the Kanto birds, the Swords of Justice), that only helps so much in allowing all legendaries to be available. But why so few? We have multiple megas at a time. With remote raiding making 1 and 3 star raids obsolete (since any level player in any location can simply post a raid and immediately have 5 people to help out remotely), it makes a lot of sense to replace those raids with legendary raids. Instead of celebrating the ChargeUp Event with raids for Voltorb and Blitzle and other electrics out in the wild, why not celebrate with Raikou, Zapdos and Zekrom? You could also keep the current system as a featured legendary by giving that legendary the only chance at a shiny or an exclusive move while keeping other legendaries in a season rotational.
* Increase the number of raid passes: It's an option that would allow trainers to do more raids, but one suspects Niantic isn't about to start giving away more things. 
* Decrease the amount of candy required to convert to XL candy. 100 to 1 is a harsh rate that ostensibly was designed to force all trainers to go back out an catch. But particularly for legendaries it's too high. Decreasing the ratio to 10 to 1, even just for legendaries, would help players get those last few candies they need to max up. 
* Increase the number of XL Rare Candy given: It's baffling that XL candy isn't part of raid rewards now. Getting even 3 rare XL candy per raid would eliminate the need for any of these other measures: you would get 90 rare candy for a month of using your free raid passes. Under this system, it's reasonable to think one could easily acquire enough XL candy to max out at least 6 mons over the course of a year depending on availability using XL rare candy acquired from raids. If XL Rare candy were included in GBL rewards or field research that would greatly improve the situation. 

Anyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading, and hopefully this gets the community talking about a problem which Niantic really needs to address.",2021-03-24 02:41:42

Yo guys. I am back and here are my top 5 premier cup teams for the Ultra league. No XL POKÉMON REQUIRED!

All these teams have been used to hit rank 24 by other content creators in season 6 and are still very strong this season too. You don’t need XL Pokémon to do well.

First team (My team)
Charizard lead
Gyarados safe switch
Shadow Swampert closer

Team 2 (Toshi double dragon team) 
Empoleon lead
Kingdra safe switch
Shadow Dragonite closer

Team 3 (Caleb Pengs shadow Machamp double tank team)
Shadow Machamp lead
Shadow Snorlax safe switch 
Lapras closer

Team 4 (2nd person in the world to hit legend in season 6)
Gengar lead
Shadow Snorlax safe switch
Obstagoon closer

Team 5 (Dunebugs #1 season 6 team to hit legend rank)
Empoleon lead
Shadow Machamp safe switch
Venusaur closer

All these teams are created by really good players and I can fully recommend them for anyone trying to hit rank 24 this season who isn’t sure what to use.

The ultra league premier cup meta is small and 10 Pokémon stand at the top. So any team could be made with the above Pokémon and will work relatively successfully.

If you want me to go further in depth with a team I can or explain some of the matchup then write them below I’m the comments and I will be happy to help.

With all that said get your popcorn and enjoy the long video. Thank you for watching and all the best with your climb to the top friends.

513,Throwing Methods,12,mbhnb6,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/mbhnb6/throwing_methods/,11,"As a background; I had NEVER played the game, never been interested in the game, never really knew any Pokémon until I downloaded it a month ago (2/25/2021). I wanted to start walking and working out again (I am recovering from a major shoulder surgery) and my girlfriend recommended I download PoGo as extra incentive to go outside, just as a motivation to explore the outdoors. She has been playing since the game came out in 2016.

I used to play and coach baseball extensively throughout my youth and college years, so I’m aware of the different type of curveballs there are and how they break (12-6, Power Curve, Knuckle Curve, Sweeping Curve, etc).

One method I’ve been using that’s been essentially foolproof is throwing Sliders/Slurves. For context a slider is a baseball pitch that moves more horizontally with higher velocity than a curveball, whereas most curveballs can be thrown with precise vertical break and drop. The exception to this would be the Slurve which combines both the horizontal running action of a slider with a 40°-45° downward vertical break of a traditional sweeping curveball. 

So basically, you are throwing a pitch with the same downward trajectory and snappiness as a curveball, with the horizontal running action a slider makes. 

It’s tougher to do with a flying type or ghost types, those are really the only outliers. I’ve had really consistent results with big and small targets and grounded targets (Good-Excellent throws, rarely anything less) and I’ve seen as a whole my throws will “catch” the corner of Pokémon I didn’t think I was remotely close to hitting. 

My method is to wind up the throw like a curveball but throw it horizontally almost out of the view of the catch screen. It’ll sweep to the middle if released perfectly and it’ll usually lean middle-left with a consistent release point. I’ve gotten to a point where I can wind up the curveball for half a second, release at the point I usually do and it makes a perfect horizontal sweeping motion to the middle of the target. 

I understand that I am new to this game and community so I could be expanding something that is elementary to veteran players of the game. I wanted to pick some of your brains and see whether or not this was something many players have tried before.",2021-03-23 23:47:30

Mega Houndoom raids will give you a Houndoom 


Field research task “Use an incense” rewards Alolan Grimer 


DRAGON TYPE


Edit: AR task removed from post, groups do not exist anymore! Irrelevant 


Rocket Ballon “ROAR! How’d that sound?” can be a Dratini or Dragonair


Windy weather boosts Dragon types so be on the lookout! Try using an incense


Gible weekly research breakthrough reward for the month of March 


Field research task “Catch a dragon type” is a Dratini encounter 


Edit to add: Field research task “Make 3 Excellent Thows in a row” reward Gible 


ICE TYPE 

Rocket Balloon “You’re gonna be frozen in your tracks” can give a Swinub, Snover, or Spheal (or even Sealo, or Cloyster) edit: correct info 


Rocket Ballon “You’ll be defeated into the ground!” has a chance to be a Swinub as well 


Field research task “Battle in the GBL” is a Swinub encounter (edit: you do not have to win, I usually rank the battles and throw out low CP shinies to get the reward quick and it gives someone else a free win)

He survived long enough for Cliff to pull a charged attack, which I blocked, and Aerodactyl actually fainted, leaving Donphan with an unreleased charge attack and a tiny bit of health remaining. I used the charge attack on his next Pokemon, which was Slowking, and of course he blocked it, but wasting one of his shields is good enough for me. I sent out Ampharos, who took care of Slowking and managed to do away with Cliff's second shield. Ampharos managed to release a charged attack on Cliff's Tyranitar, taking half of his health before succumbing. The problem is I couldn't come up with a final Pokemon strong enough to end Tyranitar - All of them bit the dust very quickly. I played out this exact same scenario four times with different finale Pokemon but I couldn't do it, so I gave up.

This morning Cliff attacked again and I thought myself better prepared. The problem is that this time, despite having the same exact line-up as last night, the outcome is completely different! Whereas Donphan took care to Aerodactyl four times in a row last night, now Aerodactyl slaughters Donphan right away with half of its health still in tact! I tried it three times to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and Aerodactyl easily beat Donphan every single time.

How the f is that possible?!? Same exact starting line-up as yesterday, but yesterday Donphan could take down Aerodactyl four times in a row in the exact same outcome, but today Aerodactyl straight-up *murders* Donphan three times in a row with exactly half his health remaining.

Fairly new player trying to build his Ultra League team. I'd like to find a good companion for my Swampert (Mudshot, Earthquake and Hydro Cannon) and Venusaur (Vine Whip, Frenzy Plant and Sludge Bomb).

I'm currently using these two with my Obstagoon, which has been going pretty well so far, but I'd like some other options.

I'd like to try a Sir Fetch'd and also a Lapras (which has Ice Shard as the fast attack).

Problem is I'm short on Stardust so I need to choose an investment carefully.

Which do you think would be best with my Swampert and Venusaur? Which one would you invest in?

I just wanted to make a post to y’all showing how much I appreciated what y’all have done for me in a cheesy, little silly way! 

I started playing at the beginning of covid, like most people my world became smaller and it was an amazing way to get motivated to explore the neighborhood... which led to exploring more hiking spots and lots of really wonderful places! It was great playing with my partner and being outside when everything in my body told me to stay in my room and stew in depression. 

I decided last week to delete the app, because in full transparency it slowly became less and less about going outside, being in nature and playing a fun little game and became more about the game itself. I think I started thinking my mindset changed when I started playing in my house instead of going outside and doing the things that really appealed to me? I wouldn’t say I was addicted by any means but I wasn’t sure if it was benefitting me. 

Things have been chill and I’ve made intentional efforts to do walks without the app but I wanted to say thanks to everyone who has helped me with the game, added me or sent me raid invites and what not. This community has been nothing but lovely to me and I think what I’ll miss is seeing all the memes and conversations. It’ll still be there but probably won’t make as much contextual sense haha.

Breeding for sure would be **incredible**. It would completely turn things around if done right so that it doesn't break the rare Pokémon economy. I'd also like to see a rework of the gym map so that it actually shows you raids locally. In its current 8-bit state it's an absolute abomination to look at.

And speaking of gyms I'd truly appreciate a means to earn coins without depending on getting kicked out everyday. I know many want 100 coins a day but 50 is better than nothing for those who don't spend money. Also, between spoofers and gym trolls it actually takes the fun out of even messing with gyms. So a new system to earn coins on our own would be great.

As such, I have a mix between 95%+ (which most of them are bad) others with questionable stats, but are ""good"" according to Poke Genie. I don't like using legendaries, because the resources are too expensive.  My biggest concerns are: Giratina, Swampert, Cresselia, Togekiss, My current lineups are:

1. Togekiss Charm and AC/AA: I don't like using Flamethrower, because I never get to use it; always my lead against Giratinas, Swampert  (in which case, it wastes both shields). I'm always countered by Venusaur's SB and Steels
2. Swampert MS and HC/EQ: Always on my team due to spamming HC to clean up. Venusaur and Giratina counter me hard, except when (IF) I can use EQ 
3. Snorlax Lick and EQ/BS: solid tank, but usually doesn't do enough damage
4. Abomasnow PS and WB I/Energy Ball: 98% but only up to 2350 CP. Really counters Venusaur, before SB, Togekiss and Giratina, but frail as F
5. Charizard FS and BB/DC: Counters Venusaur and Steels, mediocre against Giratina
6. Honckrow Snarl and DP/SA: Experimenting with her, dramtically counters Cresselia and Giratina, usually used as bait, powerful but extremely frail",2021-03-23 02:57:20

Why not have a whole party of 6 pokemon of your choosing walk along with you. Sure not all would find candy, or maybe just the leader of the troupe would find candy, but it would be cool to have more than just one buddy visible at the same time. In such way, you could bring on horde battles into pokemon go, with defeating of 5 to catch one from the group.

This might be too much of an ask as the way battles and capturing would have to change, and I don't see that happening, but it would look cool to walk along a party of your pokemon with them having a special ring around so you don't mistake them for a wild pokemon. And maybe sometimes you can click a button and the party goes searching for treasure around you bringing you back some potions or revives, or pokeballs.

The other and more reasonable idea is visible friends on map. It could be a toggle, and only if they have the online thing active on their end. Could be fun. Would definitely help with group activities of teams, be it taking over a slew of gyms, or fishing for certain type of pokemon in a larger park that is further than vicinity 9 ones listed. Or it could be team-BASED where if another red just took a gym over in your general vicinity, reds are alerted to support with their own, fostering the team theme.",2021-03-23 00:54:52

On one hand, as soon as I logged in, there's easily a dozen Pokémon swarming me but of course I can't do anything with this as I have zero Pokéballs because the ENTIRE reason I quit was because there weren't any Pokéstops to spin. Why would I pay real money for something most other players get in virtually all the amount they could ever ask for, for FREE?

Seeing how, STILL TO THIS DAY, there isn't a SINGLE stop within 20km of my home, was re-installing just a complete waste of time? I only ever got to level 26 back in 2016 because at the time (before I had no choice to move back to my hometown area) I had a friend I lived with in a completely different part of the country back then and he'd let me use his phone as a hotspot and we'd go out for walks a good amount of the time so it was easy to get levelled up.

However, being back here where I am, sorry, but I don't see any rationale behind what I can only perceive as being prodded to drive half an hour into town just to have the opportunity to play this game.

I remember one of my first Pokémon caught from the Go Battle League was a Metagross. It had a ridiculously high CP compared to my other Pokémon at the time and I hadn't even caught it's pre-evolutions. The only problem was that I only had a few Pokéballs, and I had no Razzberries. Catching this monster was so stressful. It jumped out so many times that I thought I would never catch it, and the satisfaction when I actually did catch it made it one of my favorite Pokémon that I had.

Just recently my GF was struggling with Giovanni, and she asked me to help get her a team. She has good Pokémon but none with the types that she would need, so it took a lot of strategizing and a *lot* of attempts. Watching his Garchomp two-shot the ice type I brought specifically to beat the Garchomp made me almost give up. Finally, after running very low on revives, we managed to beat him through sheer perseverance.

I’m not trying to visit a new place or walk 6km every day to max out the hearts but what is the next best way for a casual player to max the simple hearts. Can/should I start a team rocket battle, attack with buddy then back out and swap to another buddy to get multiple “battle with buddy” hearts?

Currently I only have 5 buddies that I’m looking to progress(since they’re perfect 15/15/15). Should I be looking to do it with more buddies? Which kind? 3*? High cp?
I’m doing this casually so not trying to finish in like 30 days or work a bunch for it, but what are the best simple hearts I can get and how many Pokémon should I look to try to become better buddies

I'll preface by saying I can see 5/6 gyms from my house. One of these is right on the range so it comes and goes. It was only 3 gyms but recently 3 pokestops changed to gyms for some reason. When it was 3 gyms it used to be a pretty even split of Valor, Instinct, Mystic. Since there are now 6 gyms, Mystic has moved in and controls all the gyms about 90% of the time.

I digress. Yesterday when I was driving home, this particular gym was in Valor control. I thought about taking a detour but correctly assumed that it would all be for nothing soon enough anyway. Not long after I got home, I could see that you had taken the gym. You're a low level so I wished you luck in getting your coins.

This morning my dog needed a walk. We did our usual track, past that gym. I noticed you'd been in there for 12.5 hours. Alls fair at that point so I took the gym. As my dog and I walked a little further and crossed the road, I saw it was under attack. I kept walking, it could have been anyone, but mere steps later as I came up to a corner, I looked left and there you were. We locked eyes, I don't know if you knew who I was but I know damn well who you are. It looked as though you were almost finished walking your dog, but I... I was just getting started. 

I kept walking but stayed in the area. Were you really him or were you just another trainer out catching them all? 2 minutes later the gym was again under Mystic control. Even still, were you him? I tapped the gym. I tapped the Aggron that was left there. Your name came up. It was you all along. Apparently not satisfied with your maximum number of coins for the day, maybe just hoping that you'd have the gym for the next 16 hours. You'd obviously kept walking, thinking you had done it but the comeback is always greater than the setback and I still had to come back to get home.

Sweet victory.

As part of my major research project I’m testing the effectiveness of personal assistance inside Pokémon GO and I need real GO players to test the two prototypes I created. 

The prototypes are linked below and the test is very simple. It should take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete everything. At the beginning, you will be asked some questions about how you play the game, then you will be asked to complete some tasks on the prototype. After playing with the prototype you will be prompted to some follow up questions to measure how effective the prototype was for you.

Just as a disclaimer, the prototype is quite simple and is basically a series of interactive screens (PNGs) and not a fully functional version of the game. I would love to get feedback from the community in this test, so the links are below. Click on either of them and thank you so much.

 If you have any questions, please message me 🙂

too much of a grind or too readily available,

829,Something Needs to be done about Raid Rewards.,0,m8jxy6,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/m8jxy6/something_needs_to_be_done_about_raid_rewards/,9,"TL;DR: Niantic should redo Raid Rewards to make Rare Candy guaranteed to some degree. 

&#x200B;

Call this venting if you want to, but I think I have a legitimate gripe. Maybe it's just terrible RNG luck for me, and maybe I'm not the only one, but my Raid Rewards lately are not rewarding at all. I'm not a heavy raider by any stretch, but I do pay for quite a few. I average about 5 per day, but there are days where I do double-digits. 

Yesterday, I did 9, and in those 9 raids, four of which were Thundurus. I ended up with 8 Rare Candy from those 9 Raids, and they all came in the last two: a Thundurus(6) and Shinx(2). What makes this worse, is the ungodly number of Hyper Potions and Revives that come along with the rewards. In those same 9 Raids, I ended up with 112 Hyper Potions, and 97 Revives. To add insult to injury, of those four Thundurus raids, I caught only 2 of them, despite regular Golden Razz usage, and 80+ percent Great/Excellent Throws. 

 Now, for reference, I am level 42, and I have Platinum medals in both Flying and Electric. The boss escaping wouldn't bother me so much if I was getting actual usable rewards from these raids. I know Rare Candies are still out there. I have a friend who has amassed over 400 of them. But I've been getting hosed on Rare Candy since December. Since then, I've averaged less than 2 Rare Candy per raid. Every time I contact Support they come back with the same B.S. that it's all random. 

I ask: Why? Why are the rewards random? Shouldn't you be rewarded for something that you're paying for? Why do I get 12 each of Hyper Potions and Revives when I only lost 2 or 3 Pokemon in a Raid? Why can't Rare Candy and Revives/Hyper Potions be dependent on each other? For instance, let's say your reward starts at 16 Rare Candy for a Legendary Raid. For each Pokemon that faints, you lose 2 RC that are replaced by one each Rv/Hp. So, you do a Thundurus with 3 people, and in the process, you lose 4 Pokemon. That brings you down to 8 Rare Candy, and gives you 4 Revives and 4 Hyper Potions. Is this crazy? Is this too much to ask? I'm sick of spending my hard-earned money to try to get Rare Candy, and I have nothing to show for it.

832,How I maximize a lucky egg with friendship and more,14,m8josy,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/m8josy/how_i_maximize_a_lucky_egg_with_friendship_and/,20,"I wanted to share some tips on how I maximize xp from lucky eggs. Some of this I’ve figured out as I go and I try not to think about how many lucky eggs I’ve wasted on minimal xp. I can typically get about 1 mil or more per egg doing it once per week. When the increase in friends happens it should be even better. 

Tips:

-start your egg at 11:45pm. This gives you 60 gifts to open during egg time instead of 30 (remember not to open any during the day you will use the egg)

-send gifts to those about to level up a few hours beforehand and turn off the app until 11:45. When you open the app immediately start the lucky egg to get the double xp for all the friends that opened during those hours. This also means you wouldn’t need to open their gift so you could open more of other gifts about to level

-save claiming special research task that award xp until you have an egg going

-line up eggs with the 7 day streaks for catching, spinning, and field research bonus for more xp 

-Save time and skip the opening gift animation by pressing the x right after you click the open button. 

Here is my process:

First I set get ready for the egg by
-Leveling up friends during the week until they are 1 day away from the xp bonuses (click the hearts for each friend to see how many days away you are)
-Clearing out inactive friends and adding new friends to fill any openings I have in the list (don’t open or send the new ones gifts yet which is why I usually add them same day I plan to use the egg)
-collect 40 mons to evolve and tagging them so they are easy to find

For awhile, I was doing a lucky egg once a week to coincide with my 7 day spin streak, 7 day stop streak, and field research bonus. This worked out well as it meant that a lot of the friends I added the prior week were now 1 day away from the level 2 bonus. 

Side note: I typically drop non-local friends after they get to level 2 to make more room, if you are more patient or don’t want to do eggs each week, getting them to level 3 gives you more xp per day overall but I find it harder to get the timing right without making people wait too long. (Please don’t make people wait a long time for you to open their leveling gift.) Waiting for level 3 also means less room in the list to add new people for the next egg. However with the new extended list I might reconsider this.

Around 8 pm I send gifts to friends that are about to level up, starting with ones that haven’t sent me gifts (because they are probably waiting to do a lucky egg for themselves.) Then I close the app and stay off of it until 11:45. This is so that if any of those people open the gifts the points will roll in when I have my lucky egg going. 

At 11:45 I open the app and immediately start my egg. 
Then I go open 30 leveling up gifts. 
Then I evolve 15-20 mons until midnight. 
At midnight I go back to the map and let all the friends xp and evolving xp load in then I spin my stop and catch one mon for my 7 day streaks and collect my field research bonus. 
Then I go open another 30 friends that are leveling up and then back to the map to let those roll in. 
Then claim any xp for special researches that I’ve been holding onto. 
Then evolve as many mons as I can before 12:14. 
For the last minute go back to the map to let the evolve xp and any last minute friends come in. 

Edit: please also be sure not to delete friends right away after leveling up. If they aren’t online they might not get the xp and that is rude. I try to give them at least 24-48 hours to open their app to collect the xp.

I wanted to share in case it helps people trying to grind the xp. I would also love to hear other ways people maximize their lucky eggs. 

Edit: I’d also love to hear how to maximize star dust pieces as I haven’t figured out a great plan for those yet.",2021-03-19 23:26:30

That said, what's your most fond/cherished Pokemon related memory? Anything!

For me, summer 2005, I was 14yo. I'd lost in the TX PokeTCG Championship and missed a free trip to Ohio for the US Nationals by one bad dice roll. My buddy did make the cut. We learned next day that anyone could enter as long as they paid for a 3day pass to the Comic con hosting the tourny.
I talked mom into letting me go, I flew out and roomed with my bud. Day one went extremely well, but the biggest highlight wasn't on the battleground, no.

It was meeting Mr ""SHE-BANG SHE-BANG"" himself! MR WILLIAM F***ING HUNG!

He was genuinely humble, hilarious, and quaint. A TCG fan himself, he was there to compete in the 15yo+ tourny and to report live for POJO.COM, the only real hardcore Pokemon game and TCG hub of the day. He even brought his mom along, WHO had packed all of their meals for the CON. Late Day 1, I was starving, couldn't leave bc i was awaiting my next challenger to advance, and didn't wanna Forfeit￼ for a $13 hot dog. Will and his mom saw me and for reasons still don’t understand today, they came over, sat, offered me a plate of homebrought spaghetti, and had dinner with lonely ol 14yo me. 

In the end, I placed in a 5-way tie for fifth place, missed the trip to Japan, but i wouldn’t have changed anything if i could.",2021-03-19 14:49:34

I live in a city and feel lucky that there are many raids all the time. One thing I've noticed is that players will join the lobby and camp out to see if other players will join. When the numbers are low, players will duck out before the raid begins. Sometimes I've even noticed players jumping from gym to gym where the same raid is happening until a big enough number land in one gym. It took me a sec to figure the strategy out, and I have definitely been left solo in a raid with no chance of winning. Now that I get the strategy, I do the same thing, and have had success finding large groups to raid with--so fun! 

I also recently added a number of friends off reddit. I don't know them in person or have any contact with them outside of sending gifts back and forth. I want to invite them to raids when I see them online, but I'm not sure how that works with the practice described above. Is it normal everywhere to duck out of raids when the numbers are low? If I invite a friend to a raid and duck out because numbers are low would that be seen as poor form?

Maybe I'm overthinking, but I remember the disappointment of joining a group in the lobby and being left alone in the raid, and wouldn't want to do the same to a friend.",2021-03-19 02:33:03

So i have been messing around on pvpoke, learning about teams that i could potentially build and ones that i could not however, the highest rated team that i could build on it for master league was a groudon (rated #1 overall) a melmetal (rated #2 overall) and a giratina (rated #4 overall) and it had an overall rating of A-A-B-B so... is building the perfect team impossible?

Secondly, Does the website just kind of suck since teams that ive built that the website has given meh ratings to in the past have actually worked better for me then teams that its rated higher for me. Im starting to think that this website just pulls team ratings out of nowhere 😂😂😂 for instance, the website told me that politode was a much better fit for my great league team than empoleon  however in practice when i tried both the empoleon team actually worked slightly better for me getting me a slightly higher win rate and the website didnt even take into account that my empoleon had WORSE pvp iv's (probabally the worst pvp ivs out there 15 attack) and not the ideal moveset like my politode had. Should i just ignore the website's ratings all together and build teams  off of my own intuition and calculations..?",2021-03-19 00:56:52

977,Serious answers pls: Hatching Eggs = loot boxes - Thinking'bout quiting eggs,0,m7g3zq,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/m7g3zq/serious_answers_pls_hatching_eggs_loot_boxes/,17,"**I think I'm done with eggs, and I'm considering quitting that part of the game, but I'd like to hear other points of view.**  I'm also sure that this isn't the first time that this comparison has been made, so pardon if this is a rehash.

I have few gripes/points in no specific order:

* It's a treadmill of expensive incubators that help you randomly get pokemon which is a loot box game mechanic.  Sure finishing research can result in a random encounter, but you don't have to pay money for that.  
* Yes, I know there's a free incubator, but that's Niantic covering that base that this isn't a lootbox mechanic ""because we gave you a free incubator,"" but they're also profiting on the psychology impatience which I'm tired of paying into.
* You can't transfer eggs. I'd consider doing this part of the game, if I could only focus on 7k+ or 10k+ eggs, any egg that I can define as worthwhile, but you can't do that without egg inventory management.
* Beyond the distance detail: I can't really tell if an egg is worthwhile or not.  There are no other indicators like a ""shiney"", ""lucky pokemon"", an ultra rare ""legendary"" egg.  Similar to the rare lucky trade, the eggs feature is rather non-dynamic and uninteresting.
* I feel that other consumables are better value.  For example, lucky eggs and star pieces have clear understandable benefits to the game.  Less so with incubators.

I'm sure the EA argument will be made ""It's not core to the game, and it's not 'loot boxes' is a 'surprise mechanic.'""  And to that, sure, it's not core to the game, thank god, but the naming convention is not material to what it is. I'm not ready to call it ""gambling,"" but it sure seems adjacent to it.  Other random mechanics seems further away: spinning stops, incense/lure encounters, or pokemon IV stats. 

**In any case, I hope we can have a meaningful discussion about this.**  I hope someone from Niantic reads this for feedback purposes.",2021-03-18 09:38:16
